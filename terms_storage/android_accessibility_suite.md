# Accessibility Audit

### Table of Contents

An accessibility audit is a systematic evaluation of digital platforms to determine how accessible they are to users with disabilities. An accessibility audit’s primary objective is to identify barriers that might prevent [individuals with disabilities](https://accessibe.com/glossary/person-with-disability) from fully interacting with or benefiting from a website, app, or other digital assets. By conducting these audits, individuals and organizations can gain insights into areas of improvement, ensuring that their digital content is not only compliant with legal standards but also genuinely usable and inclusive. In essence, the purpose of an accessibility audit is to bridge the gap between digital content and its diverse user base, promoting equal access and opportunity for all.

## Types of digital assets and web-based applications that can and should be audited for accessibility

While websites are the most common assets associated with digital accessibility, the scope extends far beyond. Numerous digital assets and web-based applications should undergo accessibility audits to ensure they are accessible to a person with disabilities. Below is a partial list of relevant tools and platforms:

## Web accessibility standards’ role in accessibility audits

At their core, accessibility audits examine how specific digital assets conform and adhere to relevant web and digital accessibility standards.

Web accessibility standards are guidelines and best practices formulated to ensure that digital content is universally accessible. The most important set of web accessibility standards, and those heavily impacting global web accessibility legislation, are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://accessibe.com/glossary/wcag), developed by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://accessibe.com/glossary/world-wide-web-consortium). WCAG offers a comprehensive framework for creating accessible web content, ensuring that individuals, including those with disabilities, can effectively perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with online platforms. Organized into three [conformance levels](https://accessibe.com/glossary/conformance-level) – A, AA, and AAA – each level of WCAG represents a progressively stringent set of criteria.

Beyond WCAG, there are additional standards tailored for other digital assets. For instance, the [PDF/Universal Accessibility (PDF/UA)](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/pdf.html#:~:text=PDF/UA%20%E2%80%93%20PDF/Universal%20Accessibility%20is%20the%20common%20name%20for%20ISO%2014289%2D1.%C2%A0%20PDF/UA%20provides%20requirements%20for%20PDF%20documents%2C%20viewers%2C%20and%20assistive%20technologies%20to%20ensure%20that%20accessibility%20is%20properly%20supported.) standard is specifically designed to ensure the accessibility of PDF documents. Such standards highlight the broader landscape of [digital accessibility](https://accessibe.com/glossary/digital-accessibility), emphasizing the need for diverse digital assets to be conformant to ensure universal usability.

## The different ways to conduct accessibility audits

Audits can be conducted in a variety of ways:

### Automated approach

[Automated auditing tools](https://accessibe.com/accessscan) scan digital products quickly, identifying code-level issues and flagging potential problem areas. This approach is generally cost-effective and can cover vast sections of a website in a short time. However, automated testing cannot always capture all accessibility issues, especially those related to user experience or nuanced content interpretation.

### Manual approach

Manual audits involve human experts meticulously reviewing a digital product. [Expert service providers](https://accessibe.com/accessservices) offer a depth of insight that automated tools might overlook, especially in the areas of user experience and content interpretation. The advantages of manual audits include a more thorough and detailed assessment. However, these audits can be time-consuming and typically cost more than automated audits.

### Hybrid approach

A combined accessibility auditing approach first employs automated tools to swiftly identify many basic issues. Following this, expert services are used to delve deeper, capturing issues that automated tools might have missed. This approach ensures a comprehensive audit, balancing the speed and cost-effectiveness of automated tools with the thoroughness of manual evaluation.

## Accessibility auditing under web accessibility legislation

Accessibility auditing is a critical component of [web accessibility legislation](https://accessibe.com/glossary/web-accessibility-compliance) worldwide. Several laws, such as [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://accessibe.com/compliance/section-508) in the U.S. and the [Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)](https://accessibe.com/compliance/aoda) in Canada, specifically reference WCAG as the benchmark for accessibility. These laws mandate that digital products undergo regular audits to determine their [level of conformance to WCAG](https://accessibe.com/glossary/conformance-level).

In the U.S., many courts have come to view WCAG as the standard that websites and web-based applications should conform to under the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://accessibe.com/compliance/ada-title-iii). As a result, auditing a website or digital application for ADA compliance entails a thorough examination of its conformance to the specified WCAG level. Such audits not only help organizations meet legal requirements but also emphasize the importance of creating an [inclusive digital environment](https://accessibe.com/glossary#glosI) for all users.

## The varying scopes of accessibility audits

It's crucial to determine whether the audit will cover a whole website, specific pages, or other digital assets like mobile apps. Defining the scope of an accessibility audit is foundational to the audit process, as it sets the boundaries and focus areas for evaluation. For instance, a full website audit provides a holistic view of the product’s accessibility level, while targeting specific pages can be useful for sites undergoing iterative changes or updates. Additionally, with the rise of mobile technology, ensuring the accessibility of mobile apps and responsive designs has become paramount. By clearly delineating the audit's scope, organizations can allocate resources effectively, prioritize areas of concern, and establish clear benchmarks for accessibility conformance.

## Accessibility auditing as an ongoing process

Accessibility isn't a one-time achievement; it's a continuous commitment to [inclusivity](https://accessibe.com/glossary/inclusivity). As digital platforms evolve and grow, so do the needs and expectations of their diverse user base. This makes regular auditing and updates a necessity.

To that end, organizations and individuals can follow these guidelines and best practices to ensure sustained accessibility:

### Continually check for new accessibility issues

The digital landscape is ever-changing, with new technologies, design trends, and user behaviors emerging regularly. Continuous monitoring ensures that as products update and evolve, they remain accessible. Regular checks, even between comprehensive audits, can catch and rectify issues before they escalate, ensuring a consistently inclusive user experience.

### Develop and implement mechanisms for feedback

One of the most effective ways to understand accessibility challenges is directly from users. Implementing feedback mechanisms, such as surveys or feedback forms, allows users to report accessibility issues they encounter. This feedback is invaluable, offering insights that might be overlooked in standard audits and fostering a collaborative approach to digital inclusivity. It is highly recommended to involve people with certain [disabilities](https://accessibe.com/glossary/disability) throughout this process. Ideally, [they should interact with a product or platform and provide feedback pertaining to their experience and the challenges they encountered](https://accessibe.com/accessservices/user-testing). This information should be documented and reported, thereby providing relevant stakeholders with the necessary information to take action and remediate new or lingering accessibility issues.
