        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that Temple Run 2 collects data from your device, such as unique identifiers and possibly your location, and shares it with advertisers to show you ads tailored to your interests. This data sharing could happen even if you’re not actively using the app, and it may be difficult to control or stop.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review the app’s privacy settings to see if there are options to limit data collection or opt out of personalized ads. Additionally, users can adjust their device settings (e.g., reset advertising IDs or disable location tracking) to reduce the amount of data being shared.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the collection and sharing of potentially sensitive data (e.g., location and unique identifiers) with third parties. This poses significant privacy risks, especially if users are not fully informed or given meaningful control over their data. The lack of transparency about which third parties receive the data and how it is used further exacerbates the concern."
