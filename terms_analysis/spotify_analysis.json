If you’re concerned, consider reaching out to Spotify to ask about specific safeguards or look for ways to limit the data you share with the service (e.g., by adjusting your privacy settings).",
      "severity_justification": "This is a high-severity issue because transferring data to countries with weaker privacy protections can expose users to significant risks, including unauthorized access, misuse of personal data, and lack of legal recourse if their data is mishandled.
