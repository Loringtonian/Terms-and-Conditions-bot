Terms Of Service/

Terms Of Service
================

Last updated:01/08/2024

**GENERAL INFORMATION**

*   **Introduction**

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”, “**Terms of Service**”) govern your use of our service located at [https://aisdr.com/](https://aisdr.com/) and [https://app.aisdr.com/](https://app.aisdr.com/)operated by AiSDR Inc. (“**Company**”, “**Service**” “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**”) and are a legally binding agreement between you and us.

Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard, process data collected from you and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages. Please read it here [https://aisdr.com/privacy/](https://aisdr.com/privacy/).

Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy(jointly referred to as “**Agreements**”). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.

If you do not agree with Agreements, then you must not (and you do not have our permission to) use the Service.

These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.

We may modify these Terms (as a whole or particular sections of these Terms, as may be applicable) in our sole discretion by posting updated version of these Terms on [https://aisdr.com/](https://aisdr.com/) or otherwise providing notice to you. All such changes shall become effective upon the posting of the revised Terms of Service on the Website or upon notice to you, as applicable.

*   **Communications**

By creating an Account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at.

*   **Prohibited and Unauthorized Use.**

You will not use the Service in any way that violates the terms of the Acceptable Use (provided below)or for any purpose or in any manner that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement. You will not (i) directly or indirectly reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to uncover or discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, know-how or algorithms relevant to the Services or any software, documentation or data related to the Services; (ii) modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Services (except to the extent expressly permitted by us); (iii) or remove any proprietary notices or labels.

You may not use the Service if you are legally prohibited from receiving or using the Service under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use the Service.

The Service is not designed to comply with industry-specific regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), so you may not use the Service where your communications would be subject to such laws. You may not use the Service in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

**FEES AND SUBSCRIPTION**

*   **Free Trial**

AiSDR Inc.may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“**Free Trial**”).

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by AiSDR Inc.until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice,AiSDR Inc.reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

If you register for a free trial, we will make the applicable Service available to you on a trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the free trial period (if not terminated earlier) or (b) the start date of your paid subscription. Unless you purchase a subscription to the Service before the end of the free trial, all of your data in the Service may be permanently deleted at the end of the trial, and we will not recover it. If we include additional terms and conditions on the trial registration web page, those will apply as well.

*   **Purchases**

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“**Purchase**”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.

Your payment for the Purchases may be processed by third-party payment processing providers, including, but not limited to, Stripe, PayPal or other banking or payment processing service.

You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such services or resources. When a payment is processed by such third party, its respective terms and conditions shall apply. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.

We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.

*   **Fees and Subscription**

Services are billed on a subscription basis (“**Subscription(s)**”) for a fee. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“**Billing Cycle**”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

The Subscription Fee will remain fixed during the initial term of your subscription unless (i) you exceed your applicable limits (see the ‘Limits’ section below), (ii) you upgrade products or base packages, (iii) you subscribe to additional features or products, or (iv) otherwise agreed to in your Order. We may also choose to decrease your fees upon written notice to you.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or AiSDR Inc.cancels it as described in ‘Notice of Non-Renewal’.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide AiSDR Inc.with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize AiSDR Inc.to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason,AiSDR Inc.will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

All fees are exclusive of taxes, which we will charge as applicable. You agree to pay any taxes applicable to your use of the Subscription. You will have no liability for any taxes based upon our gross revenues or net income. If you are located in the European Union, all fees are exclusive of any VAT and you represent that you are registered for VAT purposes in your member state. At our request, you will provide us with the VAT registration number under which you are registered in your member state. If you do not provide us with a VAT registration number prior to your transaction being processed, we will not issue refunds or credits for any VAT that was charged. If you are subject to GST, all fees are exclusive of GST. If you are located in Canada, all fees are exclusive of GST, PST and HST.

*   **Fee Changes**

AiSDR Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

AiSDR Inc.will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

**TERM AND RENEWAL**

*   **Term and Renewal**

Your initial subscription term will be specified in your Order, and, unless otherwise specified in AiSDR-approved form or online subscription process by which you agree to subscribe to the Service (“**Order**” or “**Order Form**”), your subscription will automatically renew for the shorter of the subscription term, or one year.

*   **Notice of Non-Renewal**

Unless otherwise specified in your Order, to prevent renewal of your subscription, you or we must give written notice of non-renewal. The deadline for sending this notice is 10 days prior to the expiration of your then-current Term.

*   **Termination for Cause**

Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause, as to any or all Services: (i) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or (ii) immediately, if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, cessation of business, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.

We may also terminate this Agreement for cause on thirty (30) days’ notice if we determine that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that has or may negatively reflect on or affect us, our prospects, or our customers.

This Agreement may not otherwise be terminated prior to the end of the Subscription term.

*   **Refunds**

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.

(iii) repeated instances of posting or uploading material that infringes or is alleged to infringe on the copyright or trademark rights of any person or entity.

*   **Suspension for Non-Payment**

We will provide you with notice of non-payment of any amount due. Unless the full amount has been paid, we may suspend your access to any or all of the Services ten (10) days after such notice. We will not suspend the Service while you are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.

(v) is causing harm to us or others, then we may, with electronic or telephonic notice to you, suspend all or any access to the Subscription Service.

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to limit the suspension to the affected portion of the Service, and each party will make reasonable efforts to promptly resolve the issues causing the suspension of the Service. Nothing in this clause limits our right to terminate for cause as outlined above, if we determine that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that has or may negatively reflect on or affect us, our prospects, or our customers.

*   **Effect of Termination or Expiration**

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, you will stop all use of the Service. If you terminate this Agreement for cause, we will promptly refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of the Service after termination. If we terminate this Agreement for cause, you will promptly pay all unpaid fees due through the end of the Subscription term. Fees are otherwise non-refundable.

**ACCEPTABLE USE**

*   **Prohibited Email Actions**

You may not use AiSDR to send spam. Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one commercial emails.

Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that have substantively similar content. One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and establish a lawful basis of processing.

You may not use the Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle, distribute or deliver: (i) spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other law; (ii) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods (e.g., scraping or harvesting); (iii) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the industry, (iv) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (referenced below), or (v) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line.

Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the Service may not: (i) use or contain invalid or forged headers; (ii) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (iii) employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path; (iv) use other means of deceptive addressing; (v) use a third party’s internet domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party’s equipment without the third party’s permission; (vi) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (vii) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s) without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.

If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers. The Sender Best Communications Practices document is available here. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to follow these practices.

You are prohibited from using the Service to email lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.

*   **Telephone, SMS, and Message Marketing**

You must comply with all laws relating to telephone marketing, including without limitation those specifically referenced in the ‘Proper Usage of Service’ section below. You must comply with all laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained prior to making any such recording. If you use the Service to place telephone calls, you must also comply with all applicable industry standards, including those applicable guidelines published by the CTIA and the Mobile Marketing Association. You are prohibited from using or permitting access to use the Service to make emergency calls or to provide or seek emergency services.

You understand that you are required to comply with carrier compliance obligations and penalties in addition to these terms, which may have additional restrictions and requirements.

*   **No Disruption**

You agree not to:

a. use the Service in a way that impacts the normal operation, privacy, integrity or security of another’s property. Another’s property includes another’s account(s), domain name(s), URL(s), website(s), network(s), system(s), facilities, equipment, data, other information, or business operations;

b. use or launch any automated system, including, “robots,” “spiders,” or “offline readers,” that sends more request messages to our servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional browser (also for example, scraping or harvesting);

c. use the Service in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs any of our websites or interferes with any other party’s use of the Service;

d. attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service;

e. access the Service using another user’s unique login credentials, including reusing or sharing unique login credentials among multiple users;

f. allow any Users to access the Service from an embargoed country, or allow access to the Service to anyone included in the U.S. Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List, Entry List, the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, or other similarly sanctioned individuals;

g. access the Service other than through our interface;

h. use the Service to gain unauthorized access to, use, monitor, make an unauthorized reference to, another’s property, unless you have the appropriate express prior consent to do so; or

i. use the Service in a way that causes or may cause any AiSDR IP addresses, AiSDR domains, or AiSDR customer domains to be blacklisted.

Examples of prohibited actions include (without limitation) include hacking, spoofing, denial of service, mailbombing and/or sending any email that contains or transmits any virus or propagating worm(s), or any malware, whether spyware, adware or other such file or program.

These restrictions apply regardless of your intent and whether or not you act intentionally or unintentionally.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

*   **Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Applicable Law**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.**

*   Arbitration and class-action waiver. 
    *   _Federal Arbitration Act_. You agree that these Terms of Service affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
    *   _Initial Dispute Resolution_. Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to litigation. You and we agree to use reasonable efforts to settle any dispute or claim, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration, other than lawsuits or arbitration for injunctive relief from alleged intellectual property infringement. To commence this procedure, you agree to contact our support department at [[email protected]](https://aisdr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99eaece9e9f6ebedd9f8f0eafdebb7faf6f4), or we may contact you using the last available information we have for you.
    *   _Binding Arbitration_. If we do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of ten (10) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then we both agree to resolve by arbitration any and all controversies, claims, or disputes arising out of, relating to, or resulting from (1) your relationship with the us, (2) these Terms of Service, (3) any other aspect of the Service. These Terms of Service are intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that lawfully can be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of these Terms of Service are expressly excluded from section 24.
    *   _Governing Arbitration Rules_. All claims subject to arbitration shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures that would permit class actions or other representative actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Service including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service (such as this section 24) is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration, except that the arbitrator shall have no authority to find that a claim may proceed on a class basis or as part of another representative action: only a court may address disputes regarding the validity or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver section below, section 24(a)(v). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, unless there are conflicting rules at www.jamsadr.com, you must do the following: (A) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover. You may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com; (B) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco California 94111; and (C) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at 2261 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94114. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not seek more than $75,000. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any remedies available under applicable law, and the arbitrator shall award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party, except as prohibited by law. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, United States of America, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any court in San Francisco County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
    *   _Class Action Waiver_. The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action, seek relief on a class basis, or join or serve as a member of a class action. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If for any reason the proper decisionmaker determines that the waiver of class and representative actions set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable or that an arbitration can proceed on a class or representative basis, then section 24(a) and section 24(b) shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
    *   _30-Day Right to Opt Out_. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by this version of section 24 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to [[email protected]](https://aisdr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cefe9ececf3eee8dcfdf5eff8eeb2fff3f1) with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the first date that you agree to any version of these Terms of Service that contains this version of section 24. If you do not opt out, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this section 24. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this section 24. You understand that you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of coverage under this section 24. If you opt out of section 24, we also will not be bound by it in disputes with you.
    *   _Changes to this Section_. We will provide (60) days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the sixtieth (60th) day, and will apply prospectively only to claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) day. If a court or arbitrator (in either case, with the authority to make such decision) decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from Section 24 and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section you agreed to.
    *   _Survival_. This section 24 shall survive any termination of these Terms of Use.

*   Limitations to this agreement to arbitrate. This section (Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) shall be limited as follows: 
    *   _Intellectual Property Claims_. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either Party may bring an action on an individual (not class or representative action) basis in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights.
    *   _Small Claims Court_. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either Party may seek relief in a small claims court on an individual (not class or representative action) basis for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

*   Applicable Law. The Terms of Service and the relationship between us shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any claim or dispute either of us may have against the other that is not subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court located in San Francisco County, California (or by a small claims court located elsewhere in the United States when section 24(b)(ii) applies). We both agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California (or a small claims court located elsewhere in the United States when section 24(b)(ii) applies), for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration.

*   Changes and Amendments to Terms. We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.

Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service. If you do not object and opt out of the amended Terms within fourteen (14) days, the amended version of the Terms is binding upon you.

*   Waiver and Severability. No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
