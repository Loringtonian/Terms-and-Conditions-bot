Subscriptions described as ad-free will still feature advertising breaks in live Content.

(d) You must not prevent, or attempt to prevent, the display of advertisements on the Service, or use any ad blocker or similar tool. If you do not comply with this requirement then we may, on reasonable notice to you:

*   (i) suspend or terminate your Subscription; or

If you opt out of changing your Subscription plan and continue to prevent the display of advertisements on our Service, then we may suspend or terminate your Subscription.

If you have a Subscription (including as part of a bundle with other services) and did not sign up on our Website or through the App, you will need to refer to the relevant third party or other service for more information about how your Subscription behaves and, how to manage it.

(b) If you are looking for more information about your Subscription, you can visit our Help Centre to find:

*   (iv) (if available in your Territory) information on how to line up a new Subscription sold by us to start when your current subscription period comes to an end, including eligibility requirements and the impact on your current Subscription.

### 4.4 Renewal of your Subscription

Certain Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel your Subscription before your next renewal date (or before the end of any free trial period or Promotional Offer period that covers the full cost of your Subscription). See Section 4.8 (**Cancellation**) for more information on how to cancel and when cancellation takes effect.

### 4.5 Free trial period

(a) Your Subscription may start with a free trial period. Free trial periods are available to new subscribers only (one per subscriber). We will inform you of the specific duration of any free trial period at the point of sign-up. You may not register (or attempt to register) multiple times for a free trial period using multiple names, addresses, email addresses or other means.

(b) You will need to provide a valid payment method at the point of sign-up and will be charged automatically at the end of your free trial period, unless you cancel your Subscription before the expiry of such period.

### 4.6 Promotional Offers

(a) Paramount, its Affiliates and/or our third party partners may make available promotional codes, discounts or other offers which may provide you with discounted access to the Service or access to the Service at no cost to you (“**Promotional Offers**”).

(b) Promotional Offers may take a variety of forms and may be made available on a standalone basis or provided as part of a bundle with other products or services sold by Paramount (or an Affiliate) or with the products or services of one of our third party partners.

(c) You may only use and redeem Promotional Offers in accordance with the specific terms and conditions which apply to them. Please check the relevant terms and conditions of the Promotional Offer for full details, including: (a) who is eligible to take up the Promotional Offer; and (b) whether restrictions apply on combining a Promotional Offer with a free trial period, or with any other Promotional Offer. You may take advantage of any “new customer” Promotional Offer only once.

(d) You may not register (or attempt to register, or otherwise benefit) multiple times for the same Promotional Offer using multiple names, addresses, email addresses or other means.

(e) Where a Promotional Offer is provided by a third party partner or an Affiliate, you may also be required to agree to the third party partner's or Affiliate's terms and conditions.

(f) If you are eligible for a Promotional Offer involving a discount, your Subscription payments will be reduced based on the terms of that Promotional Offer. After the discounted promotion period, the then regular price of that Subscription will apply.

(g) If you are eligible for a Promotional Offer that covers the full cost of your Subscription, you will still need to provide a valid payment method at the point of sign-up and will be charged automatically at the end of your promotional period unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of that period.

(h) Where a new or subsequent Promotional Offer is made available after you have signed up to your Subscription, no retrospective refunds, adjustments or price protection will be applied to your payment in light of that Promotional Offer.

### 4.7 Billing

(a) The length of your billing cycle will vary based upon the type of Subscription you choose when you subscribe.

(b) Payment will be taken automatically:

*   (i) at the start of your Subscription (or at the end of any applicable limited free trial period or Promotional Offer period that covers the full cost of your Subscription unless you have cancelled your Subscription before the end of the trial or Promotional Offer period); and
*   (ii) at the start of each billing period, if you have a recurring Subscription,

in all cases, unless you cancel your Subscription in advance of the next billing date.

(c) If you sign up to a Subscription directly from us, you authorise us to charge the payment method chosen by you when you first subscribed or any updated payment method you provide after you subscribed with the cost of your Subscription (“**Primary Payment Method**”). You may have the option to set up multiple payment methods (each of these is called a “**Backup Payment Method**” in these Terms of Use) associated with your Account. In the event you submit multiple Backup Payment Methods, you authorise Paramount to charge any such Backup Payment Method in the event the Primary Payment Method fails or cannot be charged for any other reason.

*   (i) When providing a Primary Payment Method on sign-up (or by updating it subsequently) or if you have the option to add a Backup Payment Method on your Account, a nominal charge may be temporarily taken for verification purposes.
*   (ii) Changing your Primary Payment Method or your Backup Payment Method may adjust the day upon which we usually take payment for your Subscription renewal.
*   (iii) You must not provide a Primary Payment Method or Backup Payment Method without authorisation from the relevant owner.
*   (iv) If we receive updated payment details or debit/credit card information (such as a new debit/credit card number or updated expiration date) directly from your payment service providers, you authorise us to use these new details when charging payments for your Subscription in order to prevent any interruption to your Subscription.

(d) If you sign up to any Add-Ons, such Add-Ons will be charged separately and in addition to any of your other active Subscriptions. Add-Ons may have different billing cycles to your other Subscriptions.

(e) If a payment fails, because your Primary Payment Method has expired or it is declined, you have insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not provide a valid Backup Payment Method or cancel your recurring Subscription, we reserve the right to suspend access to your Subscription and/or your Account until we (or the relevant third party) have obtained a valid payment method. In these circumstances:

*   (i) you authorise us to re-attempt the charge that was declined one or more times using the Primary Payment Method or any Backup Payment Method associated with your Account; and
*   (ii) following this, we may terminate your Subscription after we have provided written notice to you.

(f) We use other companies (including Affiliates), agents and contractors to process card transactions and other payment methods. For some payment methods, the relevant issuer may charge you certain fees, such as a foreign transaction fee or other fees relating to the processing of your payment method. Charges imposed by the relevant issuer (and any taxes applicable to such charges) may vary depending on the payment method used. You will be solely responsible for any such charges (and any taxes on such charges) which may apply. Check with your payment provider for details.

(g) To view your billing information or to update or change your payment method, go to your Account (unless you are paying via a third party or through another service, for example via Apple, Google or another of our third party partners, in which case see Section 4.9 (**Access or sign-up via third parties or Affiliates**) below).

### 4.8 Cancellation

(a) Where you have signed up to a Subscription directly with us:

*   (i) you can manage or cancel your Subscription by going to your Account at [www.paramountplus.com/account](http://www.paramountplus.com/account);
*   (ii) if you cancel your recurring Subscription in your Account:

*   (A) you will be able to continue to use your Subscription until the cancellation takes effect;
*   (B) cancellation will take effect:

*   (i) for free trials, at the end of the free trial period; 
*   (ii) at all other times, including where a Promotional Offer applies to your Subscription, at the end of your current billing period, unless you reside in the Province of Québec, in which case you may request that the cancellation take effect earlier by contacting us at [https://paramountplus.com/contactsupport](https://paramountplus.com/contactsupport);

*   (C) you will not be refunded for any fees you have paid. However, there are certain circumstances in which you may be legally entitled to a refund, which are set out in these Terms of Use, including if you reside in the Province of Québec and you request an earlier cancellation date as set out in section 4.8(a)(ii)(B)(ii) of these Terms of Use; and

*   (iii) if you cancel a Subscription with Add-Ons, your access to the Add-On will automatically come to an end when the Subscription expires. Additional terms (including refund rights) may apply on cancellation of a Subscription with Add-Ons. 

(b) The cancellation terms in this Section 4.8 (**Cancellation**) do not impact or undermine your rights in the context of a Major Change (as defined below) or, your rights in relation to any legal guarantee regarding the Service that you benefit from, as referenced in Section 14 (**Our liability to you**).

(c) If you signed up for a Subscription that is set to auto-renew through a third party (for example, via an app store or one of our third party partners) and wish to cancel it, you must follow the instructions for cancellation provided by such third party. For further details concerning your cancellation rights, see Section 4.9 (**Access or sign-up via third parties or Affiliates**).

(d) If you signed up for a Subscription via an app store, you may also have the option to delete your Account via the App. To do so, you will first need to cancel your auto-renewing payments with your app store. Deletion of your Account will mean: (i) you will permanently lose access to your Account, any profiles associated with it and viewing preferences; (ii) you will lose access to the Service immediately; and (iii) you will not be entitled to a refund from Paramount in relation to the remainder of your billing period, although you may be able to request a refund from your app store (subject to their terms and policies).

### 4.9 Access or sign-up via third parties or Affiliates

(a) Other than in relation to Add-Ons (details of which are set out below), if you sign up for, access, or pay for a Subscription (including as part of a bundle) through a third party (e.g. an app store, platform or other streaming service) or Affiliate enabling access to Content via the Website or App, separate terms and conditions will be agreed with you and will apply to such sign-up, access or payment in addition to these Terms of Use (“**Additional Terms**”).

(b) If you are paying for a Subscription via a third party or an Affiliate, or via another service, and wish to cancel or change your payment method, you will need to do so through that third party, Affiliate or other service. Where there is any inconsistency between the provisions dealing with payment, billing and cancellation rights in the Additional Terms and these Terms of Use, the provisions in the relevant Additional Terms will apply.

(c) If you have access to the Service through a bundled subscription provided by a third party or an Affiliate, or via another service, that third party or Affiliate may decide to change the characteristics, features, structure, price or other terms relating to that bundled subscription from time to time. These changes do not constitute a change to our Service or these Terms of Use, and the terms and conditions of the relevant third party or Affiliate will govern such changes (including in relation to notices, cancellation and refunds resulting from those changes).

### 4.10 Add-Ons

(a) You may be able to sign-up or gain access to an additional Subscription as an Add-On only at the point of sign-up to, or following the sign-up to, an underlying Subscription to the Service.

(b) Additional terms and information applicable to Add-Ons (such as the charges, billing dates and cancellation rights) may be disclosed during sign-up.

### 4.11 Third party or Affiliate additional services

(a) You may be able to sign up, access or purchase another Paramount service, or services operated or made available directly by a third party or Affiliate, via our Website or App (including as a standalone Subscription or bundled with a Subscription for the Service).

(b) In these circumstances, separate terms and conditions will be agreed with you in addition to these Terms of Use.

5\. CHANGES
-----------

### 5.1 Price changes

(a) We may change the price of our Subscriptions from time to time.

(b) We may increase our prices where: (i) we make improvements to the Service, Website or App; (ii) we invest in, update or improve our Content or the operation of the Service; (iii) we make updates to the Service to respond to changes in market conditions and/or market practice; (iv) events occur which are outside of our control, such as a fire, flood or storm; and/or (v) relevant to ensure compliance with applicable laws and/or to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.

(c) In addition, we provide our Service on an on-going basis and we cannot foresee what may change in the future. This means we may increase our prices for any reasons other than those set out above.

(d) We will provide you with at least thirty (30) days’ notice of any price change that applies to your Subscription. Price changes will not come into effect during your current billing period, so will only apply on renewal (if you have a Subscription that auto-renews). If you do not wish to continue your Subscription at the new price, you may cancel it before the start of the next billing period as described in Section 4.8 (**Cancellation**) or, subject to 5.1(e) if you reside in the Province of Québec, within 30 days of the new price coming into effect without cost, penalty or cancellation indemnity, meaning that if you cancel in that period we will refund the unused portion of your Subscription and the additional amount paid for the period between the effective date of the price change and your cancellation.

(e) If you have signed up to a Subscription through one of our third party partners or another service, price changes may be subject to or governed by the separate terms of that third party.

### 5.2 Content changes

(a) The Service will provide you with access to a selection of Content. This Content may change from time to time so that new content, such as programmes and channels, may become available whilst existing content will be withdrawn. The availability of Content may also change where third party rights-holders withdraw or restrict our right to use that Content on the Service, or for legal or regulatory reasons.

(b) We may make content recommendations for you based on how you use the Service, but you alone decide what you want to watch from the available Content.

### 5.3 Updates and changes to the Service

(a) We may regularly make updates and changes to any element of the Service, including its features and functionalities.

(b) Changes to the Service might be made to: (i) comply with legal or regulatory requirements; (ii) fix bugs, implement technical adjustments and make improvements; (iii) upgrade or amend the Service; (iv) alter the structure, design or layout of the Service; (v) meet testing, security and anti-piracy requirements; and (vi) reflect changes to our business.

(c) In addition, we provide our Service on an on-going basis and we cannot foresee what may change in the future. This means we may change the Service for any reasons other than those set out above.

(d) If we make any significant changes to the Service which will materially disadvantage you (“**Major Change**”), we will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the Major Change taking effect and allow you to cancel your Subscription (at no cost, penalty or cancellation indemnity to you) within this period or, if you reside in the Province of Québec, within 30 days of the Major Change coming into effect. If a Major Change takes effect during your current Subscription and you choose to cancel, we will refund any amounts you have paid for your Subscription but not yet received from the date of the Major Change. If you do not cancel before the Major Change has taken effect, we will take that as your acceptance of the changes.

(e) Unless we have expressly committed otherwise, the addition and removal of Content as described in Section 5.2 (**Content changes**), and any addition or increase in advertising or related commercial material, does not constitute a change to the Service (or any particular Subscription plan) or its scope of functions within the meaning of this Section 5.3.

(f) There may be times when the Service is temporarily restricted or unavailable to you, including due to equipment malfunctions not caused by us, routine maintenance that may temporarily interrupt the Service, or where we need to perform urgent maintenance to support your continued use of the Service or if this is necessary with regard to the security, integrity and capacity limits of the Service. Such changes shall not be considered a Major Change provided that such changes are reasonable and do not restrict your use of the Service for a significant time.

### 5.4 Updates to these Terms of Use

(a) We have the right to make changes to these Terms of Use at any time for the following reasons: (i) to correct errors, fix broken links or references; (ii) to improve clarity and/or understanding; (iii) to add additional information about the Service; (iv) where we make changes to the Service or our Subscriptions; (v) to comply with legal or regulatory requirements; (vi) where we reorganise the way we run our business, including merging with another brand or service; and/or (vii) to address security or privacy needs.

(b) In addition, we provide the Service on an ongoing basis and cannot foresee what may change in the future. This means we may make changes or additions to these Terms of Use for reasons other than those set out above, provided that such amendments are reasonable.

(c) If we change these Terms of Use in a way that will impact your legal rights or obligations, where possible we will inform you and give you the opportunity to read the new terms before such changes take effect, unless an update needs to be implemented quickly to reflect a sudden change to the Service, our business, or for security, legal or regulatory reasons (in which case we will inform you of the changes as soon as we can).

(d) If we reasonably consider that any change to these Terms of Use will materially disadvantage you, we will provide you with at least 30 days’ notice of these changes and explain how to let us know if you refuse to accept the new terms.

*   (i) If you refuse to accept the new Terms of Use before the changes are due to take effect or, if you reside in the Province of Québec, within 30 days from the changes coming into effect, the version of the Terms of Use that you previously accepted will continue to apply to your use of the Service until cancellation of your Subscription has taken effect.
*   (ii) If you do not refuse to accept any such changes before they take place, or, if you reside in the Province of Québec, within 30 days from the changes coming into effect, we will take that as your acceptance of the changes.

(e) The most up to date version of the Terms of Use will always be available on the Website and App from its effective date.

6\. ADDITIONAL CHARGES

The validity and enforceability of the remaining parts of these Terms of Use shall continue and will not be affected.

**16.4** To the extent we fail to or decide not to exercise any right of claim against you to which we are entitled, this will not constitute a waiver of that right unless otherwise indicated to you in writing.
