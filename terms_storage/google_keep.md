### Getting Started

#### [Accessing Google Keep](#accordion-content-1497882360875-accessing-google-keep)

Use Google Keep on the web or with a mobile app. Find Google Keep in the following places:

#### [Notes in Google Keep](#accordion-content-1497882415714-notes-in-google-keep)

You can create the following types of notes in Google Keep:

##### **Text notes**

Create quick notes on the go to capture your thoughts.

##### **Checklists**

Keep on top of tasks with to-do lists which can be added to or checked off from multiple devices.

##### **Voice notes**

Create a voice note which will convert to text and attach the original recording so you can play it back and hear it.

##### **Drawings**

Google Keep allows you to create a simple drawing and includes notes.

##### **Photos**

Upload an image and include your own notes. Grab a photo of a flyer, a receipt or document and easily
organize
 or find it later in the search.

### Features

#### [Set Reminders](#accordion-content-1497887094591-set-reminders)

You can create pop-up reminders for a specific note you’ve created in Google Keep and it will show up on each Google Keep session you’re running across all your devices. To create a pop-up reminder, click the icon resembling an **index finger with a string around it** at the bottom of any Google Keep note.

You can choose a specific date and time, or, if you’re using a mobile device, a location (e.g., if your location setting is enabled, a location-based reminder could pull up your grocery list right when you get to the store). Reminders can also be set to recur daily or weekly and configured to appear on your mobile device or browser.
