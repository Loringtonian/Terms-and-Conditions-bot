This analysis happens automatically and applies to nearly all content you interact with on Google's platforms, whether it's private or public. While this may enhance your user experience, it also raises significant privacy concerns, as it involves extensive data collection and profiling.",

They should also consider limiting the amount of sensitive data they upload or store on Google services and explore privacy-focused alternatives if they are uncomfortable with this level of data analysis.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the continuous and pervasive analysis of user data, including private content, which could be highly invasive. The potential for misuse, data breaches, or unintended consequences (like sensitive information being used for profiling) makes this a significant privacy concern for users, particularly those who value confidentiality and data security.",
