This includes using your private information to make recommendations, show ads, or group related content.

They should also consider whether they are comfortable storing sensitive information on Google Sheets, given the level of data analysis involved. If privacy is a concern, users may want to explore alternative services or limit the type of data they store on Google Sheets.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves extensive data processing that could include sensitive or private information. The lack of clarity around what specific data is analyzed, how it is used, and whether users can opt out entirely raises significant privacy concerns. Additionally, Canadian users, who are subject to stricter data protection laws, may find this level of data processing particularly troubling."
