          "explanation": "This means that the app has not made its terms and conditions available for review. Terms and conditions are the rules and guidelines that govern how the app operates, what data it collects, how it uses that data, and what rights users have when using the app.",
          "user_impact": "Without terms and conditions, users have no way of knowing how their personal data is being collected, stored, or shared. They also cannot understand their rights, such as whether they can delete their data, opt out of certain data uses, or seek recourse if the app misuses their information. This creates significant risks for users, as they are essentially agreeing to use the app without knowing the rules or protections in place.",
          "questions_to_ask": [
            "What data does the app collect about me, and how is it used?",
            "Does the app share my data with third parties, and if so, who are they?",

            "What happens if the app misuses my data or violates my privacy?"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "practical_meaning": "In practice, this means users are agreeing to use the app without any clear understanding of how their data is handled, what their rights are, or what obligations the app has to protect their privacy. This lack of transparency leaves users vulnerable to potential misuse of their personal information or unfair practices.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should proceed with caution when using the app. They should look for any privacy policy or terms and conditions on the app's website or contact the app developer to request this information. If no terms are provided, users may want to reconsider using the app, especially if it requires access to sensitive personal data.",
      "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because the absence of terms and conditions represents a fundamental lack of transparency and accountability. Users cannot make informed decisions about their privacy or data security, which could lead to significant risks, such as unauthorized data sharing, identity theft, or other privacy violations.",
