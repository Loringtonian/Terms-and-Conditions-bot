Additionally, users should understand the arbitration process, including costs and procedures, before agreeing.",

By agreeing to this clause, users waive their right to take legal action in court, which is a fundamental legal protection. Additionally, the prohibition on class actions makes it harder for users to hold the company accountable for widespread issues, as individuals must pursue claims alone, which can be costly and intimidating."
