    *   _Functional Cookies._ We use functional cookies to remember your choices so we can tailor our Services to provide you with enhanced features and personalized content. For example, these cookies can be used to remember your name or preferences on our Services. We do not use functional cookies to target you with online marketing. While these cookies can be disabled, this may result in less functionality during your use of our Services. 
    *   _Performance or Analytic Cookies._ These cookies collect passive information about how you use our Services, including webpages you visit and links you click. We use the information collected by such cookies to improve and optimize our Services and for analytics. You can disable these cookies as set forth below. 
    *   _Advertising or Targeting Cookies._ These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. Our third-party advertising partners may use these cookies to build a profile of your interests and deliver relevant advertising on other sites. You may disable the use of these cookies as set forth below.

*       *   _First-Party Cookies._ You may be able to use the browser with which you are viewing this Site to enable, disable or delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).

You can find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) . 
    *   _Third-Party Cookies._ If you wish to opt-in or opt-out of third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use advertising cookies, please click the "Manage Cookies" link in our website footer or visit [https://www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices) . You may withdraw your consent or update your preferences at any time by clicking the "Manage Cookies" link within the Site footer or within the Apps menu.

However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. In addition, many web browsers provide help pages relating to setting cookie preferences. 

 SHEIN adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles. 

*   **C.**_Web Pixels_ . To see how successfully our marketing campaigns or other goals of the Services are performing, we sometimes use conversion pixels, which fire a short line of code to tell us when you have clicked on a particular button or reached a particular page (e.g. a thank you page once you have completed the procedure for subscribing to one of our services or have completed one of our forms). We also use web pixels to analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage. 
*   **D.**_Analytics_ . We may use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Services. Presently, we use **Google Analytics** . Google Analytics is a web analytics service that tracks and reports Site traffic. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) . Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics, available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) . 
*   **E.**_Behavioral Remarketing_ . We also use remarketing services to advertise to you on third-party websites after you visited our Services. For this purpose, visitors are grouped by certain actions on our Services, e.g., by duration of a visit. This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalized advertising even if you are currently surfing on another website that also participates in the same advertising network. We utilize Google Ads, Bing Ads, and similar ad networks. 
*    We do not share personal information with Facebook or its parent Meta. However, we do use [Facebook Business Tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) and we may display interest-based ads to you when using Facebook. To modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Facebook, you can visit Facebook's [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053?_ga=2.209174994.1788406346.1623304331-967224649.1617743589) in addition to the Your Choices section below. We may also show ads to audiences that share similar characteristics as you. To do so, a list of email addresses is irreversibly encrypted through hashing and uploaded or transmitted from our Site, and Facebook matches the hashed data against its own users, generating a lookalike audience and deleting the uploaded list. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the "lookalike" audience, unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements. 
*   **F.**_Java Script_ . Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or "cached" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited. 
*   **G.**_Other Tracking Technologies_ . We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes. 
*   **H.**_Do Not Track Signal_ . Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Site does not currently respond to "DNT" signals. 
*   **I.**_Location Information_ . You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third-parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

 We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to guard and prevent misuse of your personal information. Our security measures include reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information.

As per our Terms and Conditions, you are not permitted to share your password with others and we strongly advise you not to re-use passwords on our Services that you use on other sites or apps, as doing so increases the likelihood of your being the victim of a credential stuffing attack or other malicious cyber behavior.

To protect the privacy and the security of your personal information, we may request data from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access such data, as well as to search for and provide you with the personal data we maintain.
