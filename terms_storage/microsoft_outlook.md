Canadian users reported outages of Outlook and Teams on Monday, following outage reports over the weekend.

Service is beginning to return for users of Microsoft Outlook after the second outage in just a couple of days. Users of Microsoft Teams were also reporting an outage on Monday.

A widespread outage on March 1 reportedly left tens of thousands of unable to use services such as Outlook, Teams and Office 365, according to an article published by [TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-outage-office-365-teams/).

In a [post on X](https://x.com/MSFT365Status/status/1895988083574681941) on March 1, Microsoft had pointed to a “problematic code change” as a reason for the weekend outage.

Following our reversion of the problematic code change, we’ve monitored service telemetry and worked with previously impacted users to confirm that service is restored. Please refer to MO1020913 in the admin center for detailed information.

[Downdetector.ca](https://downdetector.ca/), which published outage information for a variety of websites and apps, showed outage reports for Teams, Outlook and Microsoft 365 on Monday, March 3.

At 12:07 p.m. on Monday, outage reports of Microsoft 356 peaked on Monday with 2627 reports on the Canadian version of the website. At 12:02 p.m. on Monday, outage reports on Teams peaked at 1702.

In a [post on X on Monday](https://x.com/MSFT365Status/status/1896613470180680179), Microsoft acknowledged the issues with Microsoft Teams and Outlook. Microsoft said on Monday afternoon they were investigating an issue impacting Microsoft teams.

“We’ve detected a potential authentication token issue that may be contributing to impact and we’re further examining this pathway to determine our next troubleshooting steps,” Microsoft wrote.

We're investigating an issue impacting Microsoft Teams-provisioned auto attendants and call queues. For more information, please see TM1022107 in the admin center.

Users reported online having issues with logging in to their accounts — with some unable to use their Outlook email or make calls with Teams.

In an update to customers, the Microsoft 365 Status account on X confirmed a fix had been implemented after a networking issue in Canada caused Microsoft 365 services to enter “an unhealthy state” for users located in that region. Microsoft said the fix had begun to restore service for users by Monday afternoon.

The University Health Network reported that it had been impacted by the Microsoft outage affecting applications, including email and virtual appointments. Later in the day, it confirmed service had resumed.
