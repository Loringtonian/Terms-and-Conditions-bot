            "explanation": "This means Apple (and by extension, Shazam) can change the rules or conditions of using their service whenever they want, without needing to ask for your permission or explicitly notify you.",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause gives Apple and Shazam the ability to change the rules of their service at any time. Users are bound by these changes simply by continuing to use the app, even if they are unaware of the updates. This could result in users being subject to new policies or conditions that they might not agree with, such as changes to how their data is collected or shared, or new fees being introduced.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should regularly check for updates to the terms and conditions and review them carefully. If you notice changes, evaluate whether you’re comfortable with the new terms before continuing to use the service. Consider reaching out to Shazam or Apple for clarification if the changes are unclear.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it directly impacts user rights and control. The ability to unilaterally modify terms without explicit user consent creates a significant risk that users could be subjected to unfavorable or harmful changes without their knowledge or agreement. This undermines transparency and informed consent, which are critical for fair user agreements."
