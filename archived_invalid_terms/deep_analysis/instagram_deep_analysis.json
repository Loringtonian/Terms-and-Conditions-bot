            "user_impact": "Instagram is building a detailed profile of your interests, behaviors, and social connections. This information is used to personalize your experience, such as showing you specific ads or content, but it also means your data is being shared with advertisers or other third parties.",

        "practical_meaning": "Instagram is collecting a wide range of data about your activity on the platform, including your connections, interactions, and preferences. This data is used to create a detailed profile of you, which is then used for targeted advertising and potentially shared with other companies. While this may enhance your experience on the platform, it also raises significant privacy concerns, as your data could be used in ways you may not fully understand or agree with.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review Instagram's privacy settings to limit data collection where possible, such as turning off location tracking or opting out of targeted ads. They should also regularly review what data Instagram has collected about them and delete any unnecessary or sensitive information. If privacy is a major concern, users may want to consider limiting their activity on the platform or using alternative apps with stricter privacy policies.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it involves extensive data collection practices that could significantly impact user privacy. The sharing of data with third parties increases the risk of misuse, breaches, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. Users may not be fully aware of the extent of data being collected or how it is being used, which makes this a critical concern."
