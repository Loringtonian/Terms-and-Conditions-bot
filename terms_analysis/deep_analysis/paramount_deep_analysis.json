            "user_impact": "Users may lose access to their subscription if Paramount determines they are blocking ads, even unintentionally. The term 'reasonable notice' is vague and does not specify how much time users will have to resolve the issue.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What constitutes 'reasonable notice'? How will Paramount notify users of a potential suspension or termination?",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that Paramount prioritizes its advertising revenue over user preferences. Users are required to view ads unless they pay for an ad-free plan, which still includes ads during live content. If users attempt to block ads, Paramount can suspend or terminate their subscription, potentially without clear or sufficient warning. This policy may feel restrictive or unfair to users who expect more control over their viewing experience.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review their subscription plan to understand what 'ad-free' actually includes and decide whether they are comfortable with the advertising policies. Avoid using ad blockers or similar tools while using Paramount's service to prevent account suspension or termination. If you rely on ad blockers for accessibility or usability reasons, consider reaching out to Paramount for clarification or accommodations.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it directly impacts user experience and could result in the loss of access to a paid service. The policy is restrictive, potentially invasive (if ad-blocker detection involves monitoring user activity), and may mislead users about the nature of 'ad-free' subscriptions. It also raises concerns about fairness and transparency in how Paramount enforces these rules."
