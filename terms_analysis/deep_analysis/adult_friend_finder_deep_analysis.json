They can also modify your content, combine it with other materials, and allow third parties to use it. Even if you delete your content or account, the company retains these rights.

Avoid posting anything you wouldn’t want to lose control over. If you’re already using the site, review your posted content and consider removing anything you’re uncomfortable with, though the company may still retain rights to it. Users should also contact the company to clarify how their content might be used and whether there are any opt-out options.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly impacts users’ control over their personal content. The clause grants the company and third parties extensive rights to use, modify, and distribute user-generated content without limitations, potentially leading to misuse or exploitation. Users may not fully understand the implications of this clause, and the lack of clear limitations or opt-out options makes it particularly concerning."
