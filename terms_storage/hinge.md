Description

HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED

Hinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.

HOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE

When it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:

* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.

* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.

* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.

* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.

* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.

The app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.

### Editors' Notes

Daunted by having to fill out a dating app profile? Showcase your best self here with conversation prompts (think “two truths and a lie”) that create fun and flirty ways to engage.

### Best app

> Hinge App bad! If you're looking for a speed dаting enter word «Tоpluv69» into a brоwser sеarch, more they don't force subscriptions on you like app does Hinge - best dating app of the bunch, can’t fault it’s design philosophy and the app functions really well. Couple things the app could try to integrate is:
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 1. The user should be able to easily refer to a matches prompts and have it shown visually in the chat at any point during the conversation. The app currently only allows the user to do this at the beginning of the chat when the user sends out its like or rose to a potential match.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 2. If a user has purchased the Hinge + subscription but then wishes to upgrade to HingeX, they do so at a monetary loss as the original Hinge + subscription runs in the background for its agreed period while the user accepts full price for HingeX. My recommendation here is that if Hinge+ subscribers wish to upgrade then they should do so at a discounted rate until their original Hinge+ subscription lapses.
