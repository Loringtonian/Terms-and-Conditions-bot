Depending on your preferences and consent choices, we may use resettable online/device identifiers and cookies for the sake of providing you with targeted advertisements. You can read more about how we use cookies and online identifiers [here](https://www.truecaller.com/cookie-policy).

## 6. Sources from which we may collect data about you

In addition to the information that Truecaller collects directly from you, we can also collect personal data about you from someone else, i.e. third parties. For example;

**Authentication partners:** If you register for or log into Truecaller Services using another account (such as your Google or Microsoft account) that service will send your name, email address and profile picture to us. This information helps create your account with us. You can control the personal data you allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on the respective third party service. Please note that we will never store any passwords created for any third party services.

**Information other Truecaller users provide about you:** We may receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they can provide your name, phone number, whether that phone number is business or leave a comment. In that case, we use this information for the purposes of optimizing our Services and preventing potential fraud or unwanted spam for the Truecaller community.

**Third party service providers:** We work with third party service providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. This applies to processing activities such as mapping IP addresses to determine approximate location data (e.g., country or region, city, state), processing payments, understanding how people use our Services, ensuring safety, security, and integrity and helping with customer service. These companies provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues or data about your subscription status.

**Other third parties:** We may supplement the profile information provided by you with demographic information and additional contact information that is publicly available or with information received from information providers which collect data for example from public registers, telecom operators or based on a publishing certificate in order to increase the safety and quality of the content on our platform.

## 7. Storage and retention or personal data

We primarily process your data within our servers in Europe. But we may transfer your personal data to a country outside of Europe if we need to share your data with our suppliers or business partners that are established in a country outside the EU/EEA (see Section 9 for details).

We will store your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is being processed. So, the retention period depends on the purpose for which the data is being processed. Most of the time we retain it for (i) until you delete it, (ii) after a specific period of time or (iii) until your Truecaller account is deactivated and deleted.

We consider (i) the suitable storage period to fulfill our purposes, (ii) the period that our users expects us to retain their data, (iii) the time we need to keep the data to enforce our rules and keep our service secure, (iv) the legal or contractual obligation to retain or delete the data and (v) the period to keep our directory accurate and up to date as the criteria to determine retention periods.

After your Truecaller account is deleted, your data is either deleted or anonymized. We retain certain data for a longer period of time, but for very limited purposes, for example if it is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, e.g. if there is an on-going dispute or a crime has been reported to the police. We perform regular disposals and erase personal data that is no longer necessary to process.

## 8. Recipients of your personal data

Any information that you include on your profile will be seen by other Truecaller users, consistent with your settings. In this respect, you can display the name associated with a certain number for incoming or outgoing calls or following a manual number search against the Truecaller database. You may also use certain functionalities such as “who viewed my profile”, "who searched for me" and “availability” of our Services in line with the privacy settings of the other Truecaller user.

It is also possible to search for a number following a manual name search via Truecaller name search. However, we deliver a result only if that number linked to the searched name relates to a Truecaller user who has not made his/her name private. Otherwise, you can send a contact request and then that person may choose whether or not to share the phone number with you at his/her own discretion.

If you use instant verification by Truecaller, you can effortlessly sign in to services and apps offered by other companies using your existing Truecaller account. When you use Instant verification by Truecaller, we share the profile information detailed in the verification flow with the third party. We will only do this with your permission and will never share your passwords or other confidential information with such third parties.

In addition to the sharing and disclosure of personal data that as part of the functionality of the Services, Truecaller may disclose personal data to

our group companies, trusted vendors, service providers, and other partners who support our business and Services, such as providing technical infrastructure services, bug testing, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of services as well as potential partners who may wish to work with us to provide other services that interact or are integrated with our Services;

associated or affiliated organisations or related entities and to any third party who acquires our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets in order to carry out our day-to-day operations and to maintain, improve and provide the Services and acquired companies' services to you;

law enforcement and other authorities, or other parties to a dispute if and when we believe in good faith that it is necessary for us to do so, for example to comply with a legal obligation or to participate in a valid legal process.

Truecaller will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect personal data and to observe applicable legislation. Truecaller´s third party data processor list is available at <https://www.truecaller.com/third-party-data-processors>.

## 9. Transfers to countries outside Europe

If your personal data is transferred to a country outside Europe, we will take the necessary measures in order to transfer the personal data legally by ensuring that your personal data is processed securely and with an adequate level of protection that is comparable with the protection offered within Europe.

To ensure that each data transfer outside Europe complies with applicable EU law, we use the following legal mechanisms:

We use the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=EN) adopted by the European Commission as a legal mechanism for the international transfer of data to a third party located in a country outside of Europe. According to these clauses, the other party must protect your data and give you rights and protections at EU level.

We transfer personal data to countries outside of Europe that have adequate laws to protect personal data, as [decided by the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

We also identify and use additional safeguards as necessary for each data transfer by for example implementing technical safeguards, such as encryption and pseudonymisation or incorporating policies and processes for unlawful government requests that the other party might receive.

## 10. Children's privacy

Our Services are not directed at children under the relevant age of consent under the laws of their respective jurisdictions. In this respect, we do not intentionally or knowingly collect or process information from children or allow such persons to register for our Services.

If we become aware that we have collected personal data about a child under the applicable age limit, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. If you believe that we might have information from or about a child under the relevant age of consent, please contact us at [support.eu@truecaller.com](mailto:support.eu@truecaller.com).

## 11. Existence of automated decision-making and profiling with legal or similarly significant impact

We use automated systems which in some cases might involve artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning to analyze the potential spam and fraud patterns in the calls and messages that Truecaller users receive. Based on this analysis, we create profiles to display information about callers and SMS senders that are not known to Truecaller users and generate warnings about potential spam, fraud, and business communications.

We develop and train AI models using user reports to improve the detection of fraudulent and spam calls and messages. This automated processing helps us make faster, more consistent decisions and enables effective analysis of large data volumes to protect our users.

Notwithstanding this, our AI and machine learning systems do not always involve the processing of personal data. Whenever they do, we adhere to all applicable GDPR principles and process only the data necessary for these specific purposes. We implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data from unauthorised access, loss, or destruction and regularly assess and update our processing methods to ensure ongoing compliance.

## 12. Privacy settings

We want you to be in control of your privacy preferences, so we have developed a number of features in the Truecaller application and a dedicated Privacy Center to make this as easy as possible. Within the application, you can easily update your profile information and visibility to others or deactivate your account. You can also unlist your number from our search database [here](https://www.truecaller.com/unlisting).

You can also revoke any profile access granted to a third party via Truecaller verification by going to the Managed Authorization section in the application. Please note that the third party may still have access to data you have shared previously through verification by Truecaller. If you wish to have your data deleted from a third party you've previously authorized, you will need to contact that third party directly. The use of your personal data by third parties and how to exercise your rights with them are described in each third party's privacy notice.

## 13. Your rights as a Truecaller user

For example; you can request us to delete such personal data that we (i) no longer need for the purpose it was collected for, or (ii) that we process based on your consent and you revoke your consent. There are situations where we are unable to delete your data, for example, if (i) the data is still needed to process for the purpose for which the data was collected, (ii) our interest to process the data overrides your interest in having them deleted, or (iii) we have a legal obligation to keep them.

**Right to object:** You may object to the processing of your personal data which is based on our legitimate interest.

## 18. Supplemental Privacy Statement for individuals who do not have an account with Truecaller

This Supplemental Privacy Statement for individuals who do not have an account with Truecaller (a **“Non-user”** or **“you”**) supplements and should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy.

### What information do we collect about you?

Some of our features allow us to process phone numbers of both Truecaller users and other individuals who aren’t currently Truecaller users (i.e. Non-users). We process these Non-user phone numbers in a way that is designed to prevent Non-users from being identified. In most of the cases, we don’t store Non-users’ phone numbers on our servers, we only process these numbers on the Truecaller users´device. In addition, we never track the Non-user phone numbers for any reason such as targeting with ads.

If you use Truecaller verification when signing up for a third-party service, we collect your number to perform an automated verification call or to send a one time password. If you use Truecaller verification, this policy applies in relevant parts even if you do not have a Truecaller account in the application.

### How do we use a Non-user’s information?

When people sign up for Truecaller (a **“Truecaller user”**, **“they”**, **“their”**), they can choose to

grant access to their contacts in their phonebook to use our Caller ID functionality. When they do so, we use this access to identify whether the caller’s number is stored in the Truecaller users´ phonebook, and if it is, we display the stored contact information on the caller ID. We also use this access to show Truecaller users which of their contacts are also using Truecaller messaging services to make it easier to chat with them. In both cases, the access is performed on the device meaning that we only read the contact information stored locally on Truecaller users´ phone but not upload them to our servers.

report a phone number and /or an SMS as spam or provide feedback. When they do so, we process these reports to (i) identify and verify spam or malicious callers, (ii) display business or contextual information about unknown numbers such as someone you might know and (iii) provide our smart SMS features like spam filtering, fraud protection, and categorisation.

use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number as the calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages;

use our paid services, such as Call recording and Call assistant, under which we may process information about incoming calls, calling-party number and possible audio recording and transcriptions derived from the assistant or call recording. When using Call Recording, we act as a data processor for information about the audio recording and related transcription, and our user is the data controller.

Please note that we will not send you notification in such cases in line with Article 14 (5) (b) of the GDPR. Nevertheless, we shall take appropriate measures to protect your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making this information publicly available.

### What is our legal basis for this processing?

Where the processing of data does not fall under the scope of our publishing certificate, we rely on our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of our users to process Non-users’ phone numbers in the limited cases mentioned above. More specifically, we rely on our legitimate interests in operating and providing the Truecaller service to our users and keeping Truecaller safe and secure by building and maintaining our community based fraud and spam directory, and the interests of our users in more efficiently connecting with their contacts who join the Truecaller community.

### Retaining Non-user information

When we access Non-users’ phone numbers, we only store them in very limited circumstances mentioned above, and when we do so, we only retain the phone numbers for as long as it is necessary to provide the requested services by Truecaller users. We ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect your personal data from any unauthorized access, loss, or destruction.

In most of the cases, we don’t store Non-users’ phone numbers on our servers, we only process these numbers on the Truecaller users' device. In any case, we delete phone numbers reported as spam after two years starting from the creation of the spam report by a Truecaller user.

### How Non-users exercise their data subject rights

Data subjects have all the rights specified under section 13 above. To exercise those rights, contact us via the contact details provided under section 14 above. Please note that, given that we do not collect and store any information about Non-users’ other than phone numbers, our ability to respond to your request and the information we can provide to you may be limited in practice.

### Automated decision making and profiling

We use automated processing when providing our Services which in some cases might involve artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning. As part of our automated processing activities, we create spam, likely business and likely fraud profiles to display information about callers and SMS senders and warnings about potential spam, fraud and business callers and SMS senders which might belong to a “Non-user”. We use automated systems that analyze the scam patterns in the calls and SMSs that Truecaller users receive or report to help us create these profiles and then detect abuse such as spam or fraud. We also create and train AI models from user reports to detect fraudulent and spam SMSs. This leads us to quicker and more consistent decisions and helps us to analyse very large volumes of data and make solid decisions.

When we do that, we ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect personal data from unauthorized access, loss, or destruction when using AI systems.

If you think that our spam classification is not correct, you can contact us at [support.eu@truecaller.com](mailto:support.eu@truecaller.com) or unlist your phone number from our search database via <https://www.truecaller.com/unlisting>.
