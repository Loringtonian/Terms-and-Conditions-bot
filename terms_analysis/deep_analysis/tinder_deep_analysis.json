            "term": "Mandatory arbitration",
            "explanation": "This means that if you have a dispute with Tinder, you cannot take the issue to court. Instead, you must resolve it through arbitration, which is a private process where a neutral third party (the arbitrator) decides the outcome.",
            "user_impact": "You lose the right to have your case heard by a judge or jury in a public court. Arbitration can also limit your ability to gather evidence (discovery) and appeal decisions.",

            "user_impact": "If many users experience the same issue, you cannot band together to share legal costs or strengthen your case. This makes it harder to hold Tinder accountable for widespread issues.",

            "term": "Additional procedures for mass arbitration filings",
            "explanation": "If many users file similar arbitration claims, Tinder has special procedures in place to handle these cases collectively.",

        ],
        "practical_meaning": "In practice, these provisions significantly limit your ability to take legal action against Tinder. You must resolve disputes through arbitration, which is typically less favorable to consumers than court proceedings. You cannot join with other users to file a collective lawsuit, and you waive your right to a jury trial. While small claims court may be an option for minor disputes, larger claims are subject to arbitration. Additionally, Tinder has special rules for handling mass arbitration claims, which could further complicate the process.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review the arbitration rules and procedures outlined in Tinder's terms. If you disagree with these provisions, you may want to reconsider using the service. If you encounter a dispute, be prepared to follow the informal resolution process and understand the limitations of arbitration. Consider consulting a legal professional if you have concerns about your rights.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it directly impacts users' legal rights and limits their ability to seek fair recourse in disputes with Tinder. Arbitration and class action waivers are often seen as favoring companies over consumers, and these provisions could discourage users from pursuing legitimate claims due to the complexity, cost, and reduced transparency of the arbitration process."
