Resolving Disputes 

Let's tTry tTo sSort tThings oOut fFirst . We want to address your concerns without needing a formal 

legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by 

contacting dispute -notice@dropbox.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting 

you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bri ng a 

formal proceeding. 

Judicial forum for disputes . You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims 

relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco 

County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox 

consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, 

European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their 

local courts, this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements. 

IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION 

PROVISIONS: 

We Both Agree To Arbitrate . You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these 

Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator , except as 

set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” 

section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity. 

Opt -out of Agreement to Arbitrate . You can decline this agreem ent to arbitrate by clicking 

here and submitting the opt -out form within 30 days of first accepting these Terms registering 

your account . H owever, if you agreed to a previous version of these T erms that allowed you to 

opt out of arbitration , your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding . .

Arbitration Procedures . The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the 

arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for 

Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where 

you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to. 

Arbi tration Fees and Incentives . The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. 

Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000. If 

you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the 

claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' 

fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. 

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate . Either y ou or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in 

small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. 

Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse 

of the Service s, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, 

copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute -

resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to app ly to you 

or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San 

Francisco County, California to resolve your claim. 

NO CLASS ACTIONS . You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may 

not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative 

action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation 

with other arbitrations aren't allowed. If this specific paragraph is held une nforceable, then 

the entirety of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions ” section will be deemed void. 

Controlling Law These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles , unless 

otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other jurisdiction. . However, some countries 

(including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the 

local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws. 

Entire Agreement 

These Te rms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject 

matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous 

agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms 

create no third party beneficiary rights. 

Waiver, Severability & Assignment 

Dropbox's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is 

found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an 

enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign 

any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its 

rights to any of its affilia tes or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated 

with the Services. 

Modifications 

We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect: 

(a) changes to the law ,

(b) new regulatory requirements , or 

(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services. ,

If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services,

associated wi th your account or via an in -product notification. These updated terms will be effective 

no less than 30 days from when we notify you.

Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for 

Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the 

updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces
