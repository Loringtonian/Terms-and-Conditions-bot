If you shared the content with others or it was indexed by external services, it may still exist and be accessible elsewhere. This limits your ability to fully control your personal data once it has been shared or made public.",

They should also review their sharing settings and consider the implications of sharing content with others or making it public.",
      "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it directly impacts users' ability to control their personal data and privacy. The persistence of deleted content can lead to unintended exposure, misuse, or reputational harm, especially if sensitive information is involved. The lack of clarity around deletion timelines and the inability to fully retract shared content further exacerbates the concern.",
