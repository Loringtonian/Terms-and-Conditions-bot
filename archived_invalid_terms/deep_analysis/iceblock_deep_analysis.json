            "term": "We may collect and use any data you provide, including but not limited to location, device information, and usage patterns, to improve our services.",
            "explanation": "This phrase means the app can gather a wide range of personal information, including your physical location, details about your device (like model, operating system, or unique identifiers), and how you use the app (such as what features you interact with or how often). The phrase 'including but not limited to' suggests that the company can collect even more types of data beyond what is explicitly listed, without specifying limits.",
            "user_impact": "This means the app could potentially collect highly sensitive personal information, such as your exact location or detailed usage habits, even if it’s not strictly necessary for the app to function. This data could be used for purposes you may not expect, such as targeted advertising, analytics, or even sharing with third parties.",

            "user_impact": "Without a clear definition, the app could collect deeply personal or private information without your explicit consent or understanding. This increases the risk of misuse, data breaches, or unauthorized sharing.",

              "What qualifies as 'sensitive information' under these terms?",

            "explanation": "This is a broad and vague justification for data collection. It does not specify how the data will be used to improve services or what specific improvements are being made.",
            "user_impact": "This lack of specificity makes it unclear why your data is being collected and whether it is truly necessary. It also opens the door for the company to use your data for purposes unrelated to improving the app, such as marketing or selling data to third parties.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What specific improvements are being made using my data?",

This data could be used for various purposes, including those unrelated to the app's core functionality, such as advertising or sharing with third parties. Users have little control over what is collected or how it is used.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review the app's privacy policy and settings to understand what data is being collected and why. If possible, they should limit permissions (e.g., turning off location tracking) and ask the company for clarification on data usage. Users should also consider whether they are comfortable with the potential risks of using the app given the broad data collection rights.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the collection of potentially sensitive personal data without clear limits or justification. Such practices can lead to privacy violations, misuse of data, and increased risk of harm to users, such as identity theft or unwanted surveillance. The vague language also makes it difficult for users to understand or control how their data is being used."
