They should also check the app's settings to see if they can limit data collection, such as disabling location tracking or opting out of targeted advertising. If these options are not available, users may want to reconsider using the app if privacy is a major concern.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because the broad and vague data collection practices could lead to significant privacy risks. Without clear limits or transparency, users' personal information could be misused, shared with third parties, or exposed in the event of a data breach. The potential for tracking users across devices and locations further amplifies these concerns."
