You may also want to contact Audible/Amazon to ask if there is an option to opt out of arbitration or seek legal advice to understand your rights under local laws.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly impacts users' legal rights and remedies in the event of a dispute. Binding arbitration clauses and limitations on legal recourse can disadvantage consumers by restricting their ability to pursue claims in court, join class-action lawsuits, or seek full compensation for damages. These terms may also conflict with local consumer protection laws, particularly for users outside the United States, such as in Canada, where such clauses may not be enforceable or may require additional scrutiny."
