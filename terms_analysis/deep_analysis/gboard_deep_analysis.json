            "user_impact": "Your data or content (e.g., text, photos, or other inputs) could be shared with third parties or other users to make the app work as intended. For example, if you share a photo or use predictive text, that data might be processed or accessed by contractors working for Google.",

            "explanation": "This means data sharing is justified as necessary for the app to function properly, such as enabling features like predictive text, autocorrect, or sharing content with others.",
            "user_impact": "Google may share or process your data in ways you might not expect, under the justification that it is required for the app to function. This could include sharing data with other users or contractors.",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that Google can share your data with third-party contractors or other users to enable Gboard’s features to work as intended. For example, contractors might process your text inputs to improve predictive text algorithms, or data might be shared with other users when you send content through the app. While Google claims these parties are bound by agreements, there is still a risk of data being shared more broadly than users might expect.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review Google’s privacy policy to understand what data is being shared and why. If you are uncomfortable with this level of data sharing, consider limiting your use of features that require data sharing or switching to a keyboard app with stricter privacy controls. Additionally, users should inquire about opt-out options or data anonymization practices.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the potential sharing of sensitive user data (e.g., text inputs, photos) with third parties and contractors. Even though agreements are in place, there is a risk of misuse, data breaches, or broader sharing than users anticipate. The lack of transparency around what data is shared and how it is protected heightens the concern."
