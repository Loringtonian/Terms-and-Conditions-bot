# Google Lens - the Ultimate tool for visually impaired people

[Google Lens](https://lens.google/) is a free, AI-powered app designed to enhance how you interact with the world through your smartphone’s camera.

Using cutting-edge visual recognition technology, it can read and interpret text, identify objects, and even provide relevant information about what you see. This makes it an essential tool, particularly for blind and visually impaired individuals who benefit from the app's text recognition and translation features.

What sets Google Lens apart from competitors like [Seeing AI](https://www.seeingai.com/) and [Envision AI](https://www.letsenvision.com/app)? While all these apps help users navigate the world by recognizing objects and text, Google Lens offers some distinct advantages.

For instance, it's integrated with Google's search engine and tools, enabling users to access a vast database of information with ease. Whether it’s completing homework, translating a foreign menu, or extracting key details from a document, Google Lens makes these tasks quicker and more intuitive.

Ready to explore how this app can improve your life? Let’s dive into its remarkable features and how to make the most of them.

## Getting Started: Downloading and Using Google Lens

### **How to Download and Set Up Google Lens**

If you’re ready to experience Google Lens, the first step is downloading the app. On **Android**, it’s a standalone app that can be [downloaded directly from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&gl=US). For **iOS** and **iPadOS** users, Google Lens is part of the Google app, which is available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942).

Once you’ve installed the app, activating it is simple. On the app’s home screen, locate and press the “Search with Camera” button. This will launch the camera function, allowing you to point your phone at any object or text and use Google Lens’ various features.

### **Using Filters for Specific Tasks**

Before taking a picture, you can apply filters to narrow down your results. These filters are especially helpful if you’re using the app for a specific purpose, like solving math problems or translating text.

You’ll find the filter options at the bottom of the screen, and they can be easily adjusted by swiping up or down on the slider. By default, the filter is set to "Visual Search," [but it can be switched to other modes as needed.](https://9to5google.com/2023/12/15/google-lens-three-filters/)

![Three side-by-side screenshots of the Google Lens app interface, displaying different modes: 'Search with your camera,' 'Copy text from anywhere,' and 'Look up products with your camera.' Each screenshot shows a different feature at the top with the options bar for Translate, Text, Search, Homework, and Shopping below.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0813/5209/8122/files/Blog_Body_Photos_1_600x600.jpg?v=1729677735)

Once you’re ready, press the "Camera Search" button to capture the image. While the app processes the picture, it will present several action options, such as reading the text aloud, copying information, or translating it into another language.

Unlike apps such as Seeing AI, Google Lens doesn’t guide you through framing the photo, so capturing a good image may take practice.

## Accessibility of Google Lens

For blind and visually impaired users, Google Lens offers [varying degrees of accessibility](https://www.perkins.org/resource/google-lens-review-low-vision/), depending on the device. **On Android**, it integrates well with **TalkBack**, a screen reader that reads aloud the options available on the screen, making it easier for visually impaired users to navigate the app.

On **iPhone**, the experience is generally good but not perfect. At times, the app may fail to read certain buttons or elements out loud when using **VoiceOver**.

![A visually impaired woman sitting in a room, using a smartphone. She appears to be interacting with the device through touch, with a content expression on her face. The background shows shelves filled with books and binders.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0813/5209/8122/files/Blog_Body_Photos_2_600x600.jpg?v=1729677838)

Fortunately, you can manually label unspoken elements. To do this, tap the screen with two fingers twice and hold until a text field appears.

You can then enter a label for the button or element that wasn’t read aloud, making it easier to navigate in the future. After labeling, press "Save" to complete the process.

### **Challenges in Using Google Lens**

One of the [challenges](https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/getting-support/information-and-advice/how-can-technology-help-me/apps/google-lens/) visually impaired users may face is that Google Lens doesn’t offer guidance when taking a picture. Unlike **Seeing AI** and **Envision AI**, which provide feedback on how to adjust your phone’s position, Google Lens leaves it up to the user to frame the shot correctly.

This can be particularly challenging for fully blind individuals. Good lighting is crucial for accurate results, and you can use the flash option in the app to improve image clarity.

With practice and proper lighting, users can learn to capture clear images and make full use of Google Lens’ powerful features.

## All Features Explained and How to Use Them

### Search Mode: The Default Function

When you open Google Lens, it automatically starts in **Search Mode**, its default function. This mode is versatile—it analyzes the image you’ve captured and suggests the most appropriate action.

For example, if you take a photo of text, the app will present options to read the text aloud, translate it, or copy it for later use. If you take a picture of a barcode or QR code, it will provide information such as product details and prices, or direct you to a website.

For object recognition, Google Lens searches for similar images and supplies relevant information about the item, including potential purchase options or historical context.

### Translate Mode: Breaking Language Barriers

**Translate Mode** is one of the most [popular features of Google Lens](https://matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/translate-with-google-lens/), particularly for travelers and students. This mode allows you to translate text from virtually any language, directly from an image.

Whether you’re translating a document, a restaurant menu, or text from a saved image, Google Lens can instantly display the translated version.

To use this feature, simply point your camera at the text you want to translate and capture the image. Google Lens will process the text and present the translation in your selected language, overlaying the translated text on top of the original image.

You can even have the translated text read aloud using TalkBack or VoiceOver, making it especially helpful for visually impaired users.

Additionally, you can translate text from a saved image. To access this, click the button to the left of the camera search button and choose an image from your gallery.

All the same translation features will be available for saved images, including the option to copy or share the translated text.

### Homework Helper: Solving Math Problems

Though Google Lens can’t do all of your homework for you, it does offer [a unique **Homework Helper**](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/solve-math-problems-with-google-lens-homework-mode-0338976/#:~:text=Center%20the%20target%20brackets%20over,app's%20abilities%20for%20the%20latter.) feature that can assist with math problems. Simply take a picture of an equation, such as "10x + 5 = 285," and Google Lens will identify the formula and offer several options.

You can copy the equation to your clipboard, search for additional information, or even modify it using the in-app calculator.

![A person using Google Lens on a smartphone to scan a math equation displayed on a computer screen. The phone screen shows the equation '69x + 23 = 144' within the Google Lens interface, highlighting the app's ability to recognize and process mathematical formulas.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0813/5209/8122/files/Blog_Body_Photos_4_600x600.jpg?v=1729678052)

When you select the "Change" button, Google Lens opens an advanced calculator that allows you to adjust variables and re-calculate.

You can also select the "Solve" option to get a step-by-step explanation of how the equation was solved, which is a great tool for learning.

However, this feature is not fully accessible through VoiceOver or TalkBack, and users may need assistance with this particular function.

## Differences Between Google Lens and Similar Apps

Google Lens is not the only app designed to assist blind and visually impaired users with text recognition and object identification. However, it offers some unique features not found in competitors like **Seeing AI** and **Envision AI**.

![A person using the Envision app on a smartphone to scan and read aloud the text from a printed letter. The app identifies and vocalizes the address, 'James Monterrey, 35 Runner Road, 89001 Nevada,' as shown in a highlighted speech bubble on the screen. The app’s 'Scan Text' feature is demonstrated in action.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0813/5209/8122/files/Blog_Body_Photos_5_d83c3775-5cdd-47b7-af32-3e2de75d829f_600x600.jpg?v=1729678162)

**Seeing AI** and **Envision AI** provide guided assistance for taking photos, giving users verbal instructions on how to adjust the camera for the best image. This makes them more user-friendly for blind individuals.

However, Google Lens excels in its versatility. In addition to object recognition, it allows users to translate text in real-time and copy it with a single tap. Google Lens also integrates seamlessly with Google Search, giving it access to a vast pool of information.

Another key difference is the ability to upload images from your gallery and apply the same features.

Both Seeing AI and Envision AI offer this feature, but Google Lens has more tools available to process the images, such as real-time translation, barcode scanning, and product identification.
