        "practical_meaning": "The terms suggest that Amazon uses Sponsored Products and Coupons as part of its advertising and promotional strategy. However, it is unclear whether and how user data is being collected, analyzed, or shared with third parties to facilitate these promotions. This could mean that your shopping behavior, preferences, or personal information might be used to target you with ads or offers, potentially without your explicit knowledge or consent.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review Amazon's privacy policy to understand how their data is used for advertising and promotional purposes. They should also check their account settings to see if they can opt out of personalized ads or data sharing with third parties. If this information is not clear, users should contact Amazon for clarification.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves potential misuse or lack of transparency regarding user data. If personal data is being shared with third-party advertisers or used to manipulate purchasing decisions without clear disclosure, it poses significant privacy and ethical concerns. Users have a right to know how their data is being used and to make informed decisions about their privacy."
