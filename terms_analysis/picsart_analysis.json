While users can delete their content to end the license, the broad scope of rights granted raises concerns about user control over their intellectual property.",

While they claim not to own your content, the license you grant them effectively allows them to treat it as if they do, within the scope of their business and service operations.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully consider whether they are comfortable with Picsart having such broad rights to their content. If you are uploading sensitive, valuable, or personal content, you may want to reconsider or ensure your privacy settings are appropriately configured. Additionally, users should monitor how their content is being used and contact Picsart if they notice any misuse.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly impacts user control over their intellectual property. The perpetual and sublicensable nature of the license means users may lose control over how their content is used indefinitely, even after they delete it. This could lead to unexpected or undesired uses of their content, including commercial exploitation without compensation.",
