Additionally, the company has limited the amount of money you can claim in damages, even if they are at fault.",

Arbitration clauses often favor companies, and the inability to participate in class-action lawsuits can make it harder for users to address widespread issues or seek fair compensation. Additionally, the limitation on damages further reduces users' ability to recover losses, which could be particularly harmful in cases of significant harm or financial loss."
