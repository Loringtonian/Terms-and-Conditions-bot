**5. Intellectual Property**

All information and content available on the Site and its “look and feel”, including but not limited to trademarks, logos, service marks, text, graphics, photographs, button icons, images, audio clips, data compilations and software, and the compilation and organization thereof (collectively, the "Content") is the property of Bumble and bumble Canada, our affiliates, partners or licensors, and is protected by Canadian, United States and other international laws, including laws governing copyrights and trademarks. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in any manner for any purpose without our express written consent.

Except as set forth in the limited licenses in [Section 6](#limited) below, or as required under applicable law, neither the Content nor any portion of the Site may be used, reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, accessed, modified, or otherwise exploited, in whole or in part, for any purpose without our express, prior written consent.

**6. Limited Licenses**

If you make a Submission, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control the rights to your Submission and that you have the right to grant the foregoing rights to Bumble and bumble Canada. You further represent and warrant that such Submission does not constitute or contain software viruses, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam." You may not use a false email address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead us as to the origin of any Submission. You agree to indemnify us for all claims arising from or in connection with any claims to any rights in any Submission or any damages arising from any Submission.

**12. User Content**

When you transmit, upload, post, e-mail or otherwise make available data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, images, videos, messages or other materials (**"User Content"**) on the Site, you are entirely responsible for such User Content. Such User Content constitutes a Submission under [Section 11](#submision) above. This means that all third parties, not Bumble and bumble Canada, are entirely responsible for all User Content that they post to the Site. You agree not to engage in or assist or encourage others to engage in transmitting, uploading, posting, e-mailing or otherwise making available on the Site User Content that (a) is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; (b) you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (c) is known by you to be false, inaccurate or misleading; (d) you were compensated for or granted any consideration by any third party; or (e) infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary or privacy rights of any party.

You further agree not to (i) impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity; (ii) "stalk" or otherwise harass including advocating harassment of another, entrap or harm any third party including harming minors in any way; (iii) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any User Content; (iv) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, provincial, national or international law, including e-mail addresses; (v) harvest, collect, gather, assemble or store personally identifiable data about other users; or (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site, other computer systems or networks connected to the Site, through password mining or any other means.

We do not endorse or control the User Content transmitted or posted on the Site and therefore, we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of User Content. You understand that by using the Site, you may be exposed to User Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable to you. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User Content, including, without limitation, for any errors or omissions in any User Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred by you as a result of the use of any User Content transmitted, uploaded, posted, e-mailed or otherwise made available via the Site.

You acknowledge that we have the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse to post or remove any User Content and we reserve the right to change, condense, or delete any User Content. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, we have the right to remove any User Content that violates these Terms and Conditions or is otherwise objectionable and we reserve the right to refuse service and/or terminate accounts without prior notice for any users who violate these Terms and Conditions or infringe the rights of others.

**15. Disputes**

Except in Quebec, with respect to any dispute regarding the Site, all rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, as if the Terms and Conditions were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the Province of Ontario. Except in Quebec, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute relating in any way to your visit to the Site shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in the Province of Ontario and you submit to the jurisdiction and proceedings thereof, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of our affiliates, partners or licensors or otherwise have a cause of action in equity, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction and you consent to jurisdiction and venue in any such court for such purposes. Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario).

**17. General**

You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions and any and all other legal notices or statements posted on the Site constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between us concerning your use of the Site, and supersede and govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change or modify all or part of these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the changes on the Site and providing notice of such change. Except as may be prohibited by Quebec law, any changes are effective immediately upon posting to the Site and release of notice of such change.

Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between us. Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect our full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award or court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole but these Terms and Conditions shall be modified, to the extent possible, by the adjudicating entity to most fully reflect the original intent of the parties as reflected in the original provision.

If you have any questions regarding these Terms and Conditions, please [contact us](/customer-service).
