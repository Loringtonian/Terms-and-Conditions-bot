            "user_impact": "This means that Google is actively scanning and analyzing the content you upload, send, or store on its services. This data is used to tailor ads and recommendations to you, which could feel invasive if you are not comfortable with this level of monitoring.",

            "user_impact": "Your data is being continuously monitored and analyzed, even if you are not actively using the service at the moment. This could raise concerns about the extent of surveillance and how much control you have over your data.",

This analysis happens automatically and includes all content you upload, send, or store, even if it is private or sensitive. While this can enhance user experience, it also raises significant privacy concerns, as it involves extensive data collection and profiling.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review their Google account settings, particularly the Ads Settings, to understand and control how their data is being used for personalization. They should also consider limiting the amount of sensitive or private content they upload to Google services and explore options to opt out of certain types of data analysis where possible.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it involves extensive data collection and analysis that could infringe on users’ privacy. The fact that this analysis occurs at all stages (sending, receiving, and storing) and is tied to advertising and personalization makes it particularly concerning, especially for users in jurisdictions with strict privacy laws, such as Canada. Users may not fully understand the extent of this data processing or how to control it, leading to potential misuse or overreach by Google."
