            "explanation": "This refers to the app's practice of gathering information about users (such as personal details, device data, or usage patterns) and potentially providing that information to other companies or organizations. However, the terms do not specify what data is being collected, who the third parties are, or how the data is being shared.",

            "explanation": "The terms do not clearly state whether users are asked for permission before their data is collected or shared. Consent is a key principle of privacy laws in many regions, such as GDPR in the EU or CCPA in California.",
            "user_impact": "Without clear consent mechanisms, users may not be aware that their data is being collected or shared, which could violate their privacy rights and leave them unable to control how their data is used.",

            "term": "No clear opt-out mechanisms",
            "explanation": "The terms do not provide information on how users can opt out of data collection or sharing. Opt-out mechanisms allow users to stop their data from being collected or shared after they start using the app.",
            "user_impact": "Without an opt-out option, users may feel trapped into sharing their data without any control, which could lead to discomfort or distrust in the app.",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause suggests that the app collects user data and shares it with third parties, but it does not provide enough transparency about what data is collected, who it is shared with, or how users can control this process. This lack of clarity leaves users in the dark about how their personal information is being handled and whether their privacy is being respected.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review the app's privacy policy (if available) to understand what data is being collected and shared. They should also look for settings within the app to manage data sharing or opt out if possible. If the privacy policy is unclear or missing, users should consider whether they are comfortable using the app given the potential risks.",
        "severity_justification": "This concern is flagged as high severity because it involves the collection and sharing of potentially sensitive user data without clear consent or control mechanisms. This could lead to significant privacy violations, misuse of personal information, and potential legal non-compliance with privacy laws like GDPR or CCPA. The lack of transparency and user control makes this a critical issue for users to be aware of."
