This could include analyzing sensitive or private information, depending on what you share through their platform.",

If not, they may want to explore alternative messaging services that prioritize privacy.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the analysis of potentially sensitive user content, including private messages, for purposes beyond security (e.g., ad personalization). This practice could conflict with user expectations of privacy, especially in regions like Canada where stricter data protection standards are expected. Additionally, the lack of transparency about the specifics of this analysis (e.g., what data is analyzed, how long it is stored) exacerbates the concern.",
