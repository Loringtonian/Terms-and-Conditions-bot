While some of this data is necessary for the app to function (e.g., location for ride pickups), the extent of the data collected goes beyond what is strictly needed for basic functionality.",
            "user_impact": "This means Uber may be collecting more information about you than you realize, and it may not always be clear why they need this data or how it is being used. This could lead to privacy concerns if the data is shared with third parties or used for purposes you didn’t explicitly agree to.",

            "explanation": "This refers to how Uber processes the data it collects and who it shares it with. However, the document does not provide clear examples or details about these practices, leaving users uncertain about how their data is being handled.",
            "user_impact": "Without clear information, users cannot fully understand how their data is being used or who has access to it. This lack of transparency could lead to misuse of personal data or sharing with third parties without explicit consent.",

        ],
        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this means Uber collects a significant amount of personal data from users, including sensitive information like location and contacts. While some of this is necessary for the app to function, the lack of transparency around why all this data is collected, how it is used, and who it is shared with raises serious privacy concerns. Users may unknowingly consent to extensive data collection and sharing practices that they might not be comfortable with if they fully understood them.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review Uber's Privacy Notice to understand what data is being collected and why. They should also explore the privacy settings within the app to see what controls are available and consider limiting permissions (e.g., location access) where possible. If users are uncomfortable with the scope of data collection, they may want to consider alternative services with more transparent privacy practices.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it involves the collection of sensitive personal data, such as location and contacts, which can have significant privacy implications. The lack of transparency and clarity around how this data is used and shared increases the risk of misuse or unauthorized access, potentially leading to identity theft, targeted advertising, or other privacy violations. Users may not fully understand the extent of their consent, leaving them vulnerable to privacy risks."
