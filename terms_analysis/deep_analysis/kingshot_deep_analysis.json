          {
            "term": "No explicit mention of third-party data sharing practices",
            "explanation": "The terms and conditions do not clearly state if, how, or with whom your personal data is shared outside of the company. This means there is no transparency about whether your information is being shared with advertisers, partners, or other external entities.",
            "user_impact": "Without clear information, users cannot know who might have access to their personal data, how it might be used, or whether it could be sold, shared, or otherwise distributed. This lack of clarity increases the risk of misuse or unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "Does Kingshot share my personal data with third parties, such as advertisers or business partners?",
              "If data is shared, what types of data are shared and for what purposes?",
              "Does Kingshot sell user data to third parties?",
              "Are there any safeguards in place to protect my data if it is shared?"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this lack of clarity means users have no way of knowing how their personal data is handled beyond Kingshot's internal use. It could be shared with third parties without your knowledge or consent, potentially exposing you to targeted advertising, data breaches, or other privacy risks.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should contact Kingshot directly to request clarification about their data sharing practices. Additionally, users should consider limiting the personal information they provide to the service until these practices are made clear. Reviewing Kingshot's privacy policy or reaching out to their support team for specific answers is also recommended.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it directly impacts user privacy and trust. The absence of transparency around data sharing creates significant risks, including unauthorized use of personal information, potential data breaches, and loss of control over sensitive data. Users deserve to know how their data is being handled to make informed decisions about using the service."
