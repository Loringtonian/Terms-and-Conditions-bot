Look for any available opt-out mechanisms and use them if you are uncomfortable with your data being shared. Consider contacting PayPal's customer support for clarification if needed.",

Broad data sharing with third parties increases the risk of misuse, data breaches, and unwanted tracking, which can have significant consequences for users' privacy and security."
