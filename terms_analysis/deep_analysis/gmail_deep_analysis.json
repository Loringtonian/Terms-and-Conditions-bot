            "explanation": "This phrase means that Gmail will handle your personal data based on the rules and practices outlined in Google's privacy policy, which is a separate document. However, the terms do not specify what those rules are, requiring users to read and understand the privacy policy themselves.",
            "user_impact": "Users may not fully understand how their personal data is being collected, used, or shared because the specifics are not included in the Gmail terms. Instead, they are directed to another document, which may be lengthy, complex, or subject to change.",

            "user_impact": "Users must navigate and understand a separate, potentially complex document to know how their Gmail data is handled. This creates a barrier to transparency and may lead to users unknowingly agreeing to practices they are uncomfortable with.",

              "Where can I find the most recent version of Google’s privacy policy?",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that Gmail users are agreeing to the terms of Google’s privacy policy without those terms being explicitly spelled out in the Gmail terms of service. Users must take the extra step of reading and understanding the privacy policy to know how their data is handled. This could include data collection for advertising, sharing with third parties, or other uses that may not be immediately clear.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review Google’s privacy policy to understand how their data is collected, used, and shared. They should pay attention to sections about data sharing, advertising, and user rights. If users have concerns, they should consider adjusting their privacy settings or using alternative services with clearer data practices.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it creates a significant transparency issue. Users are expected to agree to data practices that are not clearly outlined in the Gmail terms, requiring them to locate and interpret a separate document. This could lead to unintentional consent to data practices that users might find invasive or unacceptable, especially for those who prioritize privacy."
