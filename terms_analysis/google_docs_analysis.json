This data is used to improve their services, detect harmful content, and personalize your experience, including showing you targeted ads. However, this also means that Google has access to a significant amount of personal and potentially sensitive information, which could be concerning for users who value privacy.",

They should also consider whether they are comfortable storing sensitive or confidential information on Google Docs, given the level of data analysis. If privacy is a major concern, users might want to explore alternative services with stronger privacy protections.",
