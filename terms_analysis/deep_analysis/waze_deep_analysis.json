Location and route information is collected for example in the form of GPS signals (combined with a time-stamp), IP address and other information from sensors and receivers on or around your device, on which the Application is installed and/or activated. This location and route information is saved to a route history of all of the journeys you have made while using the Application. The types of location data we collect depends in part on your device and account settings. For example, depending on your selected device settings and/or your account settings we may collect information about your location and travel (or lack thereof) also while you are not using the app, in order to be able to tell you when to leave for planned or predicted drives, notify you about bad traffic in your area, provide you parking assistance, analyze how effective our ads are and more; \n    *   Terms or venues you searched;\n    *   Your views and interactions with content and ads;\n    *   Your voice and audio information when you use voice and audio features;\n    *   Communication or other content you chose to share with any third party, including Waze users through the Services;\n ...",

The use of this data for advertising purposes without clear, upfront consent further compounds the concern."
