          "user_impact": "Without clear instructions on how to delete your account or remove your data, users may not be able to exercise their rights to privacy or control over their personal information. This could mean your data remains stored indefinitely, even if you stop using the app.",

      "practical_meaning": "In practice, this means that Candy Crush Saga's terms do not provide users with a clear way to delete their accounts or request the removal of their personal data. This omission could prevent users from exercising their rights under privacy laws, such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), which often require companies to provide these options.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should reach out to the company directly to ask for clarification on how to delete their accounts or request data removal. If no clear process is provided, users may need to escalate their concerns to a data protection authority or consumer protection agency, especially if they are in a jurisdiction with strong privacy laws.",
      "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it directly impacts users' ability to control their personal data, which is a fundamental privacy right. Without a clear process for account deletion or data removal, users are left vulnerable to potential misuse or indefinite retention of their personal information. This lack of transparency is particularly concerning in a digital app that likely collects significant amounts of user data.",
