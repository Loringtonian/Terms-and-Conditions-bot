## What is Google Maps?

Google Maps is a web service that provides comprehensive data about geographical regions and websites globally. In addition to standard road maps, Google Maps provides satellite and aerial views of different locations. In some states, Google Maps provides views of streets that are also composed of photographs taken from vehicles.

Google Maps provides various services as part of the bigger web application. For example, a road planner offers directions for walkers, bikers, drivers, and users of public transportation traveling from a particular location to another. Supplemental servicing provides images of the Moon, Mars, and the heavens for hobby astronomers.

## What is the Google Maps API?

The Google Maps application program interface permits various software platforms to communicate with each other. For example, website executives can embed Google Maps in an exclusive site, such as a real estate guide or a community service page.

## What is Google Maps Go?

Google Maps Go is a lower version of the Google Maps smartphone application that was released first for the Android Go edition devices. It was designed to play smoothly on devices with limited memory that are connected to the networks without coming to terms with accurate directions, real traffic updates, and transit data.
