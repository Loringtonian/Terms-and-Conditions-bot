# Stored music policy

If you have a YouTube Music account, you may be provided with server space where you will be able to upload and store certain content from your computer (for example music files that may contain metadata and album art) (“Stored Music Content”). If you choose to upload Stored Music Content, you will retain all of your existing rights to the Stored Music Content and a copy will be stored on your behalf. YouTube will make your Stored Music Content accessible to you through your YouTube Music account. Your Stored Music Content will only be accessible by you through your YouTube Music account and may not be shared by you with anyone else, including YouTube users who may be a part of your Google or YouTube Family Plan account. You are legally responsible for the Stored Music Content you upload to YouTube Music and you must not include any third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so.

We may need to make limited necessary changes to your Stored Music Content as may be needed for playback functionality on YouTube Music or through the YouTube Music app. YouTube will not share your Stored Music Content with third-parties.
