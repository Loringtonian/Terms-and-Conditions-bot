            "term": "Binding Arbitration",
            "explanation": "This means that if you have a dispute with Hulu, you cannot take them to court. Instead, the dispute will be resolved by a private third-party arbitrator, whose decision is final and legally binding.",
            "user_impact": "You lose the right to have your case heard in a public court by a judge or jury. Arbitration is often less favorable to consumers because companies typically choose the arbitration service, which may be biased.",

          },
          {
            "term": "Class Action Waiver",
            "explanation": "This means you cannot join with other users to file a lawsuit against Hulu as a group. Instead, you must resolve your dispute individually.",
            "user_impact": "You lose the ability to pool resources with other users who have similar complaints, which can make it more expensive and difficult to pursue legal action.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What happens if many users have the same issue with Hulu?",
              "Are there any exceptions to the class action waiver?",

          },
          {
            "term": "Small Claims Exception",
            "explanation": "This means that disputes that fall under the jurisdiction of small claims court (typically for smaller amounts of money) can still be resolved in court rather than through arbitration.",
            "user_impact": "You can still take Hulu to small claims court for minor disputes, but larger claims must go through arbitration.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What is the monetary limit for small claims court in my state?",
              "How do I file a claim in small claims court?",
              "Does Hulu have any restrictions on what qualifies as a small claim?"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "practical_meaning": "This clause means that if you have a dispute with Hulu, you cannot sue them in court or join a class action lawsuit. Instead, you must resolve the issue individually through arbitration, which is a private process that may favor the company. However, for smaller disputes, you can still use small claims court.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully consider whether they are comfortable giving up their right to sue Hulu in court or participate in a class action. If not, they may want to reconsider using Hulu's services. Users should also familiarize themselves with the arbitration process and small claims court rules in their jurisdiction.",
        "severity_justification": "This is flagged as high severity because it significantly limits users' legal rights and options for resolving disputes. Arbitration and class action waivers often disadvantage consumers by making it harder to hold companies accountable for widespread issues or unfair practices. This can leave users with little recourse in the event of a dispute."
