### 1.2 Descriptions of Information Collected

(a) General. When you use the Service, you can browse without submitting any personally identifiable information about
yourself. We will, however, receive and store some non-personally identifiable information about you, as described
below. In order to participate in certain functionalities, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable
information. “Personally identifiable information” is information that would allow us to actually identify you,
such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, or any other information the Service collects
that is defined as personal or personally identifiable information under applicable law. Additionally, you may also
be asked to provide information, such as details about a home or other real estate properties. Information may be
collected, for example, when you register on the Services, share or save a property via your account, save preferred
searches, correspond with real estate agents, brokers, or other real estate professionals via the Services, or
complete other forms or transactions. You may also provide information about a third party through the Services,
for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email. We may combine this information with
other information we collect from your interaction with the Services or from other companies.
  
  
(b) Account; Login. If you create an account, you will be asked to provide and we may collect certain information,
including, but not limited to, your email address and password selected by you. It is your responsibility to keep
your information up to date and to ensure that we have an active and deliverable email address for you. We are not
responsible for any problems, interruptions in access, or liability that may arise if you do not give us complete
and accurate information or if you fail to update your information so that it is current. Specific details on how to
correct or change your information are provided on the “Settings” page of “My Account.” Subscription information can
be removed from our e-mail lists by changing the “Unsubscribe” settings.
  
  
(c) Payments. If you make a payment to MoxiWorks, we will ask for information required for payment processing, such as
credit or payment card number, expiration date, CVV number, billing address, company name, and additional information
required for payment processing (**Payment Information”**) and other information requested for processing your payment.
We use third-party payment processors, currently Shopify and Braintree, (each, a **“Payment Processor”**) to assist in
securely processing your Payment Information. The Payment Information that you provide through the Services is
encrypted and transmitted directly to a Payment Processor. We do not store your Payment Information and do not
control and are not responsible for Payment Processors, or their collection or use of your information. You may
find out more about how Shopify stores and uses your Payment Information by accessing the privacy policy for Shopify’s
services (see <https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy>). You may find out more about how Braintree stores and uses your
Payment Information by accessing the privacy policy for Braintree’s services
(see <https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/braintree-privacy-policy>.)
  
  
(d) Public Content. You may provide information through the Service that is intended for public consumption and is
therefore viewable by the public, including photos, ratings, reviews, tips, lists, and real estate
listing information.
  
  
(e) Location Information. If you use our Service, we may receive your generic location (such as city or neighborhood) or,
with your consent, precise geographic location data.
We may use and store this information to provide and improve features of our Service. For example, to tailor our Site on a needs-based manner to better facilitate your use and
to provide you more relevant content about real estate in your city or cities you visit.
  
  
(f) Automatically Collected Information. Similar to other websites and services, we may collect some information automatically and store it in log files. We may use third-party
analytics providers (**“Analytics Providers”**) to collect this information about the Service. See subsection 1.2(g) below
(Third-Party Analytics) for more information on our use of Analytics Providers and the information collected by
such providers. This collection may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, browser type and language,
device type, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages,
cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date
and time of each request you make. We collect this non-identifying information in order to better understand our
users, to more efficiently operate our business, to promote our services and to improve the quality of the Service.
We may automatically collect information using various tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons.

1. Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a computer or
   smartphone for record-keeping purposes. Our Analytics Providers use cookies to record information about your activities while using the Service
   and to “remember” you when you return to the Service. Some cookies remain on your computer or device until you
   delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your browser. You may set your browser or device
   setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Service, however, certain features of the Service may
   not be available if your browser or device does not accept cookies. See subsection 1.2(h) (“Do Not Track” Settings)
   below for more information on how the Service may respond to your browser or device settings. We do not control the
   use of cookies by third parties. See also Section 3.6 (Disclaimer) below.
2. Web Beacons. Web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags,
   and single-pixel gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web or mobile app users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on
   a computer’s hard drive or your smartphone, web beacons are small graphics that are about the size of the period
   at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on, for example, web pages or in HTML-based emails.
   Our Analytics Providers may place web beacons on the Site that track what other websites you visit (both before
   and after visiting the Site). Our Analytics Providers use information obtained from web beacons to help us
   improve our business and the Service. We do not control the use of web beacons by Analytics Providers.

(g) Third-Party Analytics. We use Analytics Providers, such as Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies, to collect information
about Service usage and users of the Service. These Analytics Providers may use cookies and pixels to collect usage
information from users that visit the Service, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the
Service, what pages users view on the Service, time spent on each page, browser version, operating system, internet
protocol address, and geolocation information. These technologies allow the Analytics Providers to recognize a user
when a user visits the Service and when the user visits other websites. The Analytics Providers share the information
they collect from the Service and from other websites with us and other website operators, including but not
limited to age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests and details about devices used to visit
websites and purchase items. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or you may opt out of
Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page. For more information regarding Google’s collection
methods and use of information, see Google’s privacy policy by visiting the following link: <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en>.
If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.
  
  
(h) “Do Not Track” Settings. Because we track Service usage information through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other tracking mechanisms,
your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser or smartphone may not have any effect on our
collection of information via tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any
information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser and
smartphone to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. Getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work
as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by
browsers: unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all
settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be
collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be
able to control other websites.
  
  
We may use or disclose the personal information identified above for one or more of the following business purposes
(**“Business Purpose”**), as further described in Sections 2 (Information Use) and 3 (Information Disclosure):

* To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information (e.g., to help provide products and services to you).

managing and administering the Service, tracking users’ movements, to create new products or services or to
improve our business and the Service. In addition, we may share aggregate statistical information with our business
partners. We may also combine your non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information with other
non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information collected from other sources. We will take
reasonable steps to ensure that aggregate information is never associated with you or your personally identifiable information.

information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information immediately and delete it from our
servers. If you believe information from a child under the age of 13 has been provided to the Service, please notify
us at: [privacy@moxiworks.com](mailto:privacy@moxiworks.com).

## 6. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

### 6.1 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, we process your personal information in accordance with the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
  
  
**Sale of personal information**. MoxiWorks does not sell your personal information. Because of this we do not
offer an option to opt-out of the sale of personal information.
  
  
**Your rights**. Under the CCPA, you have the right to request that (i) we disclose what personal information about you
has been collected, used, disclosed, and sold, and (ii) we delete your personal information. You or an authorized
agent acting on your behalf may submit a request for either a disclosure (i) or a deletion (ii). Authorized agents
or delegates should provide the MoxiWorks support team with the name of the requestor who they are acting on behalf
of, their brokerage name, and their MLS ID in order to authenticate the requestors information.
  
  
Exercising your rights. You can exercise your rights and submit CCPA disclosure or deletion requests by (i)
submitting a web form at <https://moxiprivacy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new> or by (ii) contacting support through
our dedicated toll-free line at (888) 447-0733. Exercising these CCPA rights will not result in discriminatory
treatment from MoxiWorks, such as degrading your service quality or charging a higher fee for our products and
services. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on
your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a
verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
  
  
You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a twelve-month period. The verifiable
consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about
whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient
detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
  
  
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer
request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a
verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
  
  
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require
more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12)
month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the
reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from
one entity to another entity without hindrance.
  
  
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive,
or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision
and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### 6.2 CALIFORNIA SHINE THE LIGHT LAW

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free
of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personally identifiable information (if any) for
direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such
a request, please send an e-mail with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line to [privacy@moxiworks.com](mailto:privacy@moxiworks.com).

## 7. CANADIAN RESIDENTS

The Services and our privacy practices are compliant with the fair information principles of The Personal
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (**“PIPEDA”**). In addition to the disclosures made above, we:

* Only use and disclose personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

personal information. Additionally, you have the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information
and request to have it amended as appropriate. Finally, you have the right to challenge MoxiWorks’s compliance with
the PIPEDA fair information principles by contacting our privacy officer. To exercise your rights under
this section, please send an e-mail to [privacy@moxiworks.com](mailto:privacy@moxiworks.com) or write us at:
  
  
MoxiWorks, LLC

Seattle, WA 98104.

## 8. NON-U.S. AND NON-CANADIAN RESIDENTS - CONSENT TO SUBMIT INFORMATION

The Service is not intended for use outside the United States or Canada, or by non-U.S. or non-Canadian residents.
If you provide personally identifiable information to us, it may be transferred to and processed on computers in the
United States and other countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area. Do not provide personally
identifiable information to us if you do not want or consent to this information being transferred to the United
States or to other countries, which may not have privacy (data protection) legislation or regulation comparable to
the law of the country in which you reside. Your provision of personally identifiable information to us will be
handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your provision of personally identifiable information to us through
the Service means that you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 9. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS FOR EEA AND CERTAIN OTHER TERRITORIES

If you are from certain territories (such as the European Economic Area (EEA)), you may have the right to exercise
additional rights available to you under applicable laws, including:

* Right of erasure: In certain circumstances, you may have a broader right to erasure of personal information
  that we hold about you – for example, if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
  it was originally collected. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record
  keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.
* Right to object to processing: You may have the right to request that MoxiWorks stop processing your personal
  information and/or to stop sending you marketing communications.
* Right to restrict processing: You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your
  personal information in certain circumstances (for example, where you believe that the personal
  information we hold about you is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
* Right to data portability: In certain circumstances, you may have the right to be provided with your
  personal information in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we
  transfer the personal information to another data controller without hindrance.

If you would like to exercise such rights, please contact us at the contact details in the Site section
“Contacting MoxiWorks.” We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your
privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request. You also
have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.
For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

## 10. LINKED SITES

The Service or users of the Service may provide links to other websites or resources (**“Linked Sites”**).
You acknowledge and agree that MoxiWorks does not endorse and is not responsible for any content, advertising,
products, services or other materials on or available through Linked Sites. Linked Sites are subject to different
terms of use and privacy policies, which you should review.

## 11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time upon notice to you. We may give notice by making the
updated Privacy Policy available in the Service or by any other reasonable means. You can access and review the most
current version of this Privacy Policy at any time at https://moxiworks.com/privacy-policy. The updated Privacy
Policy is binding on you as of the next date that you use the Service after the date of updated Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree to the updated Privacy Policy, you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the
Service after the effective date posted at the top of this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the
updated Privacy Policy.

## 12. ACCESSING OR UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION

MoxiWorks provides you with the opportunity to know about the information that MoxiWorks holds about you, together
with the ability to correct, amend or delete, as appropriate, any such information that is incomplete or inaccurate.
Should you wish to exercise any of these options or should you have any questions or concerns about information that
MoxiWorks has collected in relation to you, please feel free to contact us by emailing [privacy@moxiworks.com](mailto:privacy@moxiworks.com).
We will make good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccurate information except where the request
is unreasonable, requires disproportionate technical effort or expense, jeopardizes the privacy of others, or
would be impractical. If your account is terminated for any reason, your information will no longer be accessible
through your account or associated with your account. However, activity that occurred prior to deletion may still
continue to be stored on our systems or the systems of our service providers indefinitely.

## 13. ENFORCEMENT

at [privacy@moxiworks.com](mailto:privacy@moxiworks.com), and we will endeavor to review and correct the problem promptly.
