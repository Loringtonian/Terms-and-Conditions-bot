            "explanation": "The terms do not specify how long Microsoft retains user data, what happens to your data after you unsubscribe, or how you can request its deletion. This lack of clarity leaves users in the dark about how their personal information is handled over time.",
            "user_impact": "Without knowing how long your data is stored, you cannot assess the risks of your information being exposed, misused, or retained indefinitely. This is especially concerning for sensitive data, such as emails or personal details, which could be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access.",

            "explanation": "The terms do not provide a clear or accessible way for users to request the deletion of their personal data. This means users may not know how to exercise their rights to control their information.",
            "user_impact": "If you cannot easily request data deletion, your personal information may remain stored indefinitely, even if you no longer use the service. This could increase your exposure to privacy risks, such as data breaches or misuse of your information.",

              "How can I request the deletion of my data?",

        ],
        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this means Microsoft has not provided users with sufficient transparency about how long their data is kept or how they can remove their data from Microsoft's systems. This lack of clarity could result in users' data being retained indefinitely without their knowledge or consent.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review Microsoft's privacy policy in detail to see if any additional information about data retention or deletion is provided. If not, users should contact Microsoft directly to ask about their data retention and deletion policies. Privacy-conscious users may also want to consider whether they are comfortable using a service without clear data retention practices.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue was flagged as high severity because unclear data retention policies can have significant privacy implications. Indefinite or poorly defined data retention increases the risk of personal data being exposed in breaches, misused, or retained against the user's wishes. Additionally, the lack of a clear deletion mechanism undermines users' ability to control their own information, which is a fundamental privacy right under laws like GDPR and CCPA."
