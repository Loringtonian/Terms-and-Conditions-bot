Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

We value your personal information as if it is our own. We want your experience on our site to be of value and importance to you as well as provide you with fun products. We make every effort to protect data privacy and confidentiality. This Privacy Policy applies to the DoorDashStore.com website, which is administered by a third party service provider to DoorDashStore.com. We use the personal information you provide us in some areas of this site to provide you with the best customer experience. The amount and type of information you provide depends on how you use this site. Information may be stored and used to enhance your experience.

In all cases, your use of DoorDashStore.com implies your agreement to the terms of this privacy policy. You also grant DoorDashStore.com permission to collect information about the pages served to you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics.

**Information we Collect**

When you interact with the Site, we may collect (and have collected):

We do not offer financial incentives for you to provide your data to us beyond what is captured in the terms of the sweepstakes, surveys, and contests.

**Cookies, IP Address, and Other Technologies**

When you visit DoorDashStore.com, we automatically assign you a permanent “cookie” (a small text file) that is stored on your hard drive. The purpose of this cookie is to identify you when you visit the Site so that we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience.

You can choose to browse on DoorDashStore.com without cookies. However, without these identifier files you will not be able to complete a purchase or take advantage of certain features of the Site. These features include storing your shopping cart for later use and providing a more personalized shopping experience.

Each browser is different, so check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to DoorDashStore.com. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer’s operating system, browser type and the address of a referring website, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to the Site and do not sell or rent this information to any third parties.

**How we use your personal information**

We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to benefit all users of this site. This same information may be shared with third parties who analyze, store, or aggregate this information for us. It may also be shared with other third parties who work with us to improve our services or this website.

Information we collect on DoorDashStore.com may be used to enhance your shopping experience in the following ways:

**When and with whom we share your personal information**

We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. We share personal customer information and/or purchase history only with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including but not limited to: fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with this Site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers’ shopping experience; administering or facilitating surveys, contests or sweepstakes; offering targeted marketing communications to users that opted-in to receive such communications; enabling access to our partners’ websites; providing a personalized shopping experience; preventing fraud; and completing payment method processing.

Aside from the purposes described above, we do not share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability), or to comply with legal processes and orders (subpoenas, warrants, and etc.). We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners, but this is not linked to any personal information that can identify you or any individual person.

In addition to the information you provide to us, we obtain the following information from third parties: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers’ activities on the Site; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the Site. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies. Each browser is different, so check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You can further disable targeted advertising by opting out of tracking by a number of advertising companies by using the portal provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance [here](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

**Security**

We understand the importance of information security and take reasonable measures to protect the security and confidentiality of your information in line with industry standards. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), an industry-standard encryption method. We do NOT keep your credit card information on file. While we realize this is potentially less convenient for future ordering, we feel that the safest way to protect your credit card information is not to store it, but request it each time your purchase.

Please note that email is not encrypted and not considered a secure way to transmit your credit card information. We will never ask you for your credit card information by email.

**Children**

We do not solicit or knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has been using our systems, please inform us using the contact information below and we will remove it from our systems. We have no knowledge that we sell the data of minors under 16 years of age.

**California Data Rights**

If you are a California resident, you have the following rights:

We will comply with your request to access a copy of your personal information unless:

Please note however that we may be barred by law from disclosing certain sensitive information in response to your request.

We will comply with your request to delete your personal information unless we must maintain it to:

The process for requesting these rights is as follows:

Authorized Agent. You have the right to designate an authorized agent to submit an access or deletion request on your behalf. Agents can submit requests as if they were the person they are representing, using the above methods. If you use an authorized agent to submit such a request, we will require that you:

No Discrimination. We will not discriminate against a California resident because the California resident exercised any of the rights described above.

**Changes to our privacy policy**

This Web site Privacy Policy is effective as of May 15, 2020. It may be necessary to make modifications or amendments to this Policy. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notification. However, changes will not be applied retroactively and will not alter the management of previously collected information. If changes are made to this Policy, we will post the revised version on this Web site so you may want to periodically review this section for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.
