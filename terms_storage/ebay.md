Since signing on with Accountor CPA three years ago, we have nearly doubled our business growth year on year. With their expert advice and practical help with accounting and tax filing for our Amazon business, we have been able to grow way faster than we imagined.

I thought I had a good set up for my A2X and related software, but the accountants at Accountor CPA advised me to make some changes and upgrades to see if I could improve my business growth.

## Do I Need Accounting and Tax Software as an Ebay Seller?

If you are selling products on Ebay in Canada, you need to have a solid understanding of your bookkeeping, accounting, and tax obligations. If you do not charge sales tax in Canada on required products, you can find yourself facing harsh penalties and legal action by the Canadian government.

If a product is purchased by a Canadian on Ebay from a seller abroad, they should be paying Canadian sales tax on it, which you are then required to remit to the government. Depending on which province the individual is in, you may have to track and charge GST, HST, and/or PST, and then file taxes in multiple jurisdictions at the end of your tax period.

If you miss a tax filing period, are late on a tax charge due date, or completely fail to register for tax accounts, you can incur hefty penalties from provincial governments and federal entities. This can have a huge impact on your bottom line in this niche industry.
