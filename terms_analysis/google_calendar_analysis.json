      "explanation": "Google retains broad rights to use, modify, and sublicense user content for purposes such as improving services and promoting its products. While this is standard for many platforms, the scope of the license (worldwide, royalty-free, and perpetual) raises concerns about user control over their content.",

The ability to modify, create derivative works, and sublicense the content to third parties increases the risk of misuse, misrepresentation, or unauthorized access.
