What is Genshin Impact?

## Welcome to Teyvat - a beautiful fantasy world where the seven elements flow and converge.

Genshin Impact is an open-world adventure RPG.

Set forth on a journey across a fantasy world called Teyvat. In this vast world, explore seven nations, meet a diverse cast of characters with unique personalities and abilities and fight powerful enemies together with them, all on the way during your quest to find your lost sibling.

Wander freely, immersing yourself in a world filled with life, and let your sense of wonder lead you to uncover all of its mysteries.

That is, until you are at long last reunited with your lost sibling and bear witness to the culmination of all things at the end of your journey.

A Space and Time for You

## Genshin Impact Version 5.7 update

With Version 5.7, A Space and Time for You, the Traveler's sibling will continue to advance their grand plan. As the Traveler unites their allies to confront the Abyss Order in Natlan, more hidden truths about Teyvat will gradually come to light, marking a pivotal turning point in the story.  
  
 Meanwhile, two familiar faces from the main story – Skirk and Dahlia – will also become playable characters. As a skilled sword master, Skirk fights without relying on Elemental Energy, dominating in extended battles or with sudden bursts of damage.  
  
 While tensions run high in the Archon Quest, there will also be time to enjoy some lighter moments. Test your tactical thinking in a simulated adventure game, reunite with old friends in the next chapter of Travelers' Tales, and take on challenges in a new permanent combat mode.
