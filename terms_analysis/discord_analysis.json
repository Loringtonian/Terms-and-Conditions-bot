This includes not only what you do on the platform but also potentially sensitive financial and moderation-related information.

They should also be cautious about sharing sensitive information on the platform and consider whether they are comfortable with the level of tracking described. Moderators and users engaging in transactions should be particularly aware of the implications.",

This level of tracking could pose significant privacy risks, especially if the data is misused, shared with third parties, or exposed in a breach. Additionally, many users may not fully understand the extent of this tracking or how to control it.",
