        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause allows the app to share your personal data with advertisers, who can then use it to target you with ads, analyze your behavior, and potentially share it further. While the app claims to ask for your consent, the way this consent is obtained and the lack of clarity around how your data is used make it difficult to fully understand or control what happens to your information.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review any consent requests and avoid agreeing to data sharing unless they fully understand what is being shared and how it will be used. Look for options to opt out of personalized ads or data sharing in the app’s settings. If no clear options are provided, consider contacting the app’s support team for clarification.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves sharing personal data with third parties for their independent use, which significantly reduces user control over their information. The vague language and potential for misuse or further sharing of data amplify the privacy risks, especially for users who may not fully understand the implications of their consent."
