      "user_action_needed": "Users should review their Google Pay settings and inquire about whether their actual card numbers are being stored. If possible, they should request to opt out of storing the real card number. Additionally, users should enable strong security measures, such as two-factor authentication, for their Google Payments account.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because storing actual card numbers increases the risk of financial fraud and identity theft in the event of a data breach or unauthorized access.
