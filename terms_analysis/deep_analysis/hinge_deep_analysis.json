Look for options to limit data collection or sharing, such as opting out of targeted advertising or requesting data deletion. Consider whether you are comfortable with the level of data collection and sharing before continuing to use the app.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the collection and sharing of potentially sensitive personal data, which could lead to privacy risks such as data misuse, profiling, or exposure to unwanted targeted advertising. Users may not be fully aware of the extent of data collection or have control over how their data is shared."
