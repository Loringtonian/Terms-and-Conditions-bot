Look for options to opt out of personalized ads or data sharing in the app’s settings. If no clear options are provided, consider contacting the app’s support team for clarification.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves sharing personal data with third parties for their independent use, which significantly reduces user control over their information.
