I want to create an app that is a one-stop shop for people to come to and have complicated terms and conditions simplified for them. So we're building a scraper with the Tavily integration to go crawl the web and find terms and conditions for the most popular apps in the app store and the Play Store and all that. So we need to create a list of the top 100 most popular apps or something like that and find all of their terms and conditions. So after that, then we have some kind of an agent framework to analyze the terms and conditions. We'll need a system prompt. We'll need source documentation. We'll need some kind of baseline against which to compare terms and conditions to find out where the departures from conventions are to be able to rate them out of 10 or on some other scale for how friendly they are to the user. Are you basically selling yourself and the data of all the people around you to this app by clicking accept on the terms and conditions? Score the terms and conditions on a variety of metrics. So we'll need to flesh all of that out but the point of the app is a user comes to the app, they type the name of a service. If we don't have the terms and conditions already crawled and stored and analyzed, then we go out and we do that for them live. But if they have, maybe we later we'll have some workflow for updating terms and conditions but for now we'll just do a one time crawl. We'll find the terms and conditions and specifically because a lot of corporations have different terms and conditions depending on where you live, we'll be specifically targeting Canada right now. So if the Tavily MCP server needs to select a geographic region or something like that, we'll make sure that we're pulling English terms and conditions for Canada. So I think we're going to have a Flask Python app on the back end and we're going to serve it up through a local host for now. I want a clean modern UI and mostly grayscale with legal thematic overtones. So we'll need to pull in a development and agent kit. I'm thinking of Google's Python ADK agent development kit which we can find online and I believe we can implement it fairly easily. I think that's a good start.
