      "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that if you have a dispute with Netflix, you cannot sue them in court or join a class action lawsuit with other users. Instead, you must resolve the issue through arbitration, which is a private process that often favors companies over individuals. The only exception is if your dispute qualifies for small claims court, which has strict limits on the types and amounts of claims it can handle.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully consider whether they are comfortable giving up their right to sue Netflix in court or join a class action lawsuit. If not, they may want to reconsider agreeing to these terms. Users should also familiarize themselves with the arbitration process and the small claims court rules in their jurisdiction.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly limits users' legal rights and options for resolving disputes. Arbitration often favors companies, and the class action waiver prevents users from pooling resources to address widespread issues, which can make it harder for individuals to hold Netflix accountable for potential wrongdoing.",
