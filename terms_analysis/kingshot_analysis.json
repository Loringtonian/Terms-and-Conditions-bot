          "explanation": "The terms and conditions do not clearly state if, how, or with whom your personal data is shared outside of the company. This means there is no transparency about whether your information is being shared with advertisers, partners, or other external entities.",
          "user_impact": "Without clear information, users cannot know who might have access to their personal data, how it might be used, or whether it could be sold, shared, or otherwise distributed.

It could be shared with third parties without your knowledge or consent, potentially exposing you to targeted advertising, data breaches, or other privacy risks.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should contact Kingshot directly to request clarification about their data sharing practices. Additionally, users should consider limiting the personal information they provide to the service until these practices are made clear. Reviewing Kingshot's privacy policy or reaching out to their support team for specific answers is also recommended.",
      "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it directly impacts user privacy and trust. The absence of transparency around data sharing creates significant risks, including unauthorized use of personal information, potential data breaches, and loss of control over sensitive data. Users deserve to know how their data is being handled to make informed decisions about using the service.",
