This data sharing is used to create a more personalized experience, target advertisements, and improve services across all Meta platforms.",
            "user_impact": "Your personal data is not just used within Instagram but is shared across all Meta platforms and potentially with third-party partners. This could mean that your activity on Instagram influences what you see on Facebook or WhatsApp, and vice versa. It also means that Meta has a very detailed profile of you, which could be used for targeted advertising or other purposes.",

            "user_impact": "While this may make using Meta platforms more convenient, it also means that Meta is constantly tracking and connecting your activity across all its platforms, which could feel invasive. It also increases the amount of data Meta collects about you.",

This data is used to create a unified experience across Meta's ecosystem, target advertisements, and improve their services. However, it also means that Meta has an extensive profile of you, which could be used in ways you may not fully understand or agree with.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review Instagram's Privacy Policy to understand what data is being collected and how it is being shared. They should also explore privacy settings on Instagram and other Meta platforms to limit data sharing where possible. If concerned, users may want to consider whether they are comfortable with the level of data collection and sharing described.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves extensive data collection and sharing, which could significantly impact user privacy. The lack of transparency about what data is collected, how it is shared, and with whom raises concerns about potential misuse or overreach. Additionally, users may not fully understand the implications of their data being shared across multiple platforms and with external partners."
