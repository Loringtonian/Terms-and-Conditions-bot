This data can be used to enhance your experience on LinkedIn (e.g., better job recommendations or networking suggestions) but also for targeted advertising or other purposes that may not be transparent to you. The broad scope of data sharing increases the risk of your personal information being used in ways you didn’t anticipate or consent to.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should review LinkedIn’s privacy settings to see if they can limit data sharing with partners and affiliates. They should also consider contacting LinkedIn to request details about what data is being shared and with whom. If concerned, users may want to avoid linking or sharing additional data through Microsoft services or third-party platforms connected to LinkedIn.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because the broad and vague language around data sharing creates significant privacy risks. Users may not fully understand the extent of data sharing or how their information is being used, which could lead to misuse, unauthorized profiling, or exposure to targeted advertising without explicit consent. The involvement of a major company like Microsoft further amplifies the potential for large-scale data aggregation and privacy concerns.",
