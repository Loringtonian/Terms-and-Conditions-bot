        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that even though Google Pay uses Virtual Account Numbers for transactions, it may still store your real card number in your Google Payments account. This could expose your card to risks if Google’s systems are breached or if your account is hacked.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review their Google Pay settings and inquire about whether their actual card numbers are being stored. If possible, they should request to opt out of storing the real card number. Additionally, users should enable strong security measures, such as two-factor authentication, for their Google Payments account.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because storing actual card numbers increases the risk of financial fraud and identity theft in the event of a data breach or unauthorized access. While Google likely has strong security measures, no system is completely immune to breaches, and the storage of sensitive financial information heightens the potential impact of such incidents."
