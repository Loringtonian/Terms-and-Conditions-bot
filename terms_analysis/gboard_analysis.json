      "explanation": "Google's terms grant them a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, modify, and distribute user content for purposes such as improving services and promoting them. While this is common, the scope of rights granted may concern users who value strict control over their content.",
      "quote": "This license allows Google to: host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go."

      "severity": "medium",
      "explanation": "Google reserves the right to analyze user content and update services automatically, which may involve significant data processing. While this is aimed at improving services, it could raise privacy concerns for users who prefer more control over how their data is used.",

  "summary": "Google's terms for Gboard are generally clear and align with standard practices for large tech companies. However, the broad rights granted to Google over user content, extensive data processing for service improvement, and potential data sharing with third parties may raise privacy concerns for Canadian users. The terms are moderately user-friendly but could benefit from more transparency and user control over data usage.",

For example, contractors might process your text inputs to improve predictive text algorithms, or data might be shared with other users when you send content through the app. While Google claims these parties are bound by agreements, there is still a risk of data being shared more broadly than users might expect.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should review Google’s privacy policy to understand what data is being shared and why. If you are uncomfortable with this level of data sharing, consider limiting your use of features that require data sharing or switching to a keyboard app with stricter privacy controls. Additionally, users should inquire about opt-out options or data anonymization practices.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the potential sharing of sensitive user data (e.g., text inputs, photos) with third parties and contractors. Even though agreements are in place, there is a risk of misuse, data breaches, or broader sharing than users anticipate. The lack of transparency around what data is shared and how it is protected heightens the concern.",
