          "explanation": "This means Microsoft can change the rules or conditions of using OneDrive at any time without telling you directly (e.g., via email or notification). Instead, they expect you to periodically check the terms yourself to stay updated.",
          "user_impact": "Users might unknowingly agree to new terms that could significantly affect their privacy, data usage, or rights. For example, Microsoft could introduce new policies about how your data is shared or stored, and you might not realize it unless you manually check the terms.",

If you don't regularly check the terms, you might miss updates that could affect your rights or how your data is handled.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should periodically review Microsoft's terms of service to stay informed about any changes. Alternatively, users could contact Microsoft to ask if there is a way to receive notifications about updates. If you notice a change you disagree with, you may need to stop using the service or contact Microsoft for clarification.",
      "severity_justification": "This is flagged as high severity because it places an unreasonable burden on users to monitor changes that could significantly impact their privacy or rights. Without direct notification, users are at risk of unknowingly agreeing to terms that may not align with their expectations or preferences. This lack of transparency undermines informed consent.",
