   - [x] Set up document caching with versioning
   - [ ] Build comprehensive scraper for app stores (In Progress)
   - [ ] Implement automated change detection

2. **AI Analysis**
   ```python
   # Current analysis schema
   TCAnalysis = {
       "app_name": str,
       "overall_risk_score": float,  # 0-10
       "privacy_concerns": [{
           "clause": str,
           "severity": float,  # 0-1
           "explanation": str,
           "recommendation": str
       }],
       "summary": str,
       "key_points": [str],
       "analysis_date": "iso_timestamp",
       "source_url": str
   }
   ```
   - [x] Implement OpenAI GPT-4o integration
   - [x] Create analysis service with structured output
   - [x] Add rate limiting and error handling
   - [ ] Improve prompt engineering for better accuracy
   - [ ] Implement deep analysis features

## Phase 3: Backend Services (Partially Implemented)
1. **API Endpoints**
   ```
   GET /health - Service health check
   GET /services - List all analyzed services
   GET /analysis/{service_id} - Get analysis for specific service
   POST /analyze - Submit new service for analysis
   ```
   - [x] Implement core endpoints
   - [x] Add response caching
   - [x] Set up background task processing
   - [ ] ~~Add authentication~~ (Not needed - per developer request)
   - [ ] Implement comparison endpoint (Pending frontend work)

2. **Services**
   - [x] Analysis service for T&C processing
   - [x] Document management service
   - [x] Vector store integration
   - [ ] ~~User management service~~ (Not needed - per developer request)

## Phase 4: Frontend (In Progress)
1. **Core UI**
   - [x] Set up Next.js project
   - [x] Create basic page structure
   - [ ] Implement service search functionality
   - [ ] Build results display with scoring
   - [ ] Create comparison view

2. **User Experience**
   - [x] Set up Tailwind CSS
   - [ ] Implement responsive design
   - [ ] Add loading states and error handling
   - [ ] Create dashboard for user history

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] Basic API testing
- [ ] ~~Comprehensive end-to-end testing~~ (Handled by developer)
- [ ] ~~Error condition testing~~ (Handled by developer)
- [ ] ~~Performance optimization~~ (Not needed at this time)
- [ ] ~~Security audit~~ (Not needed at this time)

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python 3.10+, Flask
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o with structured output
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Search**: Tavily API
- **Storage**: Local file system with vector store
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 13+ with React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Development & Operations
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Containerization**: Docker (basic setup)
- **CI/CD**: ~~GitHub Actions~~ (Not needed - per developer request)
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging (sufficient for now)

## Integration Status

### Implemented Integrations
1. **Tavily API** - For T&C discovery and search
2. **OpenAI API** - For T&C analysis
3. **Vector Store** - For document embeddings and semantic search
4. **File System** - For document storage and caching

### Integration Notes
*Note: The following integrations are not currently planned unless specifically requested by the developer*
- ~~User Authentication~~
- ~~Production Database Migration~~
- ~~Redis Caching~~
- ~~Advanced Monitoring~~

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key
- Tavily API key (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Set up environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal (backend)
   python -m src.terms_analyzer.api.app

   # In another terminal (frontend)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Notes

### Current Focus (Frontend Development - Pending Developer Action)
1. Implement service search functionality
2. Build results display with scoring
3. Create comparison view
4. Add responsive design
5. Implement loading states and error handling

### On Hold (Do Not Implement Without Explicit Instruction)
- User authentication
- Rate limiting
- Infrastructure changes
- User experience improvements
- Future enhancements (mobile app, browser extension, etc.)

### Testing Approach
- Basic API testing completed
- Further testing to be handled by the developer
- No additional QA automation needed at this time
