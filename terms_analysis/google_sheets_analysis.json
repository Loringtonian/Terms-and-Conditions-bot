If not, they may want to explore alternative tools or services with stricter privacy controls.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because users may not fully understand the extent of data sharing or the potential implications. The lack of transparency about who the 'partners' are and how the data is used creates a significant risk of misuse or unintended consequences, such as profiling or targeted advertising without explicit consent. Additionally, users may not have sufficient control to opt out of this data sharing, which undermines their privacy rights.",
