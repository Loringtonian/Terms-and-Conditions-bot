This means your data might be used for targeted advertising, analytics, or other purposes that extend beyond YouTube itself. This could result in your data being used in ways you didn’t explicitly agree to or expect, such as receiving ads based on your YouTube activity or having your data analyzed by companies you’ve never interacted with.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review YouTube’s privacy settings to see if they can limit data sharing or opt out of personalized ads. They should also read YouTube’s privacy policy to understand what data is collected and shared. If privacy is a major concern, users might consider using YouTube while logged out or through privacy-focused tools like ad blockers or VPNs.",
        "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it involves the potential for widespread sharing of personal data without clear user consent or understanding. The broad scope of data sharing, including with future Alphabet companies or unknown third parties, poses significant privacy risks. Users may not fully grasp the extent of this sharing or have sufficient control over their data, which could lead to misuse or exploitation of their personal information."
