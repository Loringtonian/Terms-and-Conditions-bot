Shell Canada app
================

Has anybody had problems with using the Shell Canada app for paying for fuel or purchases through their app with the Google wallet? I'm having issues and confirmed with Shell that the issue is not the app but it's coming from Google wallet. All other features in the wall at work but just with the app alone, it will not work

Thanks for the info James, unfortunately it's still has an issue. The Google pay system is not supported through their app. Other features using Visa, MasterCard work but Google pay still does not allow it to work. Shell has informed me that it is on the Android side/ google pay system that has the problem.
