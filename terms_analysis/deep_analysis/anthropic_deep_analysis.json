        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review the company's Privacy Policy to understand how their data is shared and used. They should also ask for more details about the third parties involved and their data protection practices. If the Privacy Policy is unclear or overly broad, users should consider whether they are comfortable proceeding with the service.",
        "severity_justification": "This concern is flagged as high severity because it involves the sharing of sensitive personal and financial information with third parties, potentially without adequate transparency or safeguards. This could lead to significant privacy risks, such as unauthorized use of data, identity theft, or non-compliance with privacy laws like Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)."
