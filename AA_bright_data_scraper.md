# Bright Data Scraper

## Overview
This service was used for web scraping tasks that required handling JavaScript-rendered content and bypassing anti-scraping measures. Bright Data's residential and datacenter proxies helped us gather data from websites that implement strict bot detection.

## Key Features Used
- Residential proxies for human-like browsing patterns
- Automatic IP rotation to prevent IP-based blocking
- JavaScript rendering for dynamic content
- Request throttling to avoid overwhelming target servers

## Implementation Notes
- Used Bright Data's proxy service to route requests through different geographic locations
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- Leveraged browser automation for sites requiring interaction
- Handled CAPTCHAs and other anti-bot measures through Bright Data's infrastructure
