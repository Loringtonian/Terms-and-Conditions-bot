      "practical_meaning": "This clause means that most users in the United States (and potentially other countries outside of Quebec) are required to resolve disputes with Airbnb through private arbitration rather than in court. Additionally, users cannot band together to file class action lawsuits, which can limit their ability to hold Airbnb accountable for widespread issues. Quebec residents are exempt from these restrictions if they file claims in Quebec, but this exemption does not apply to them when traveling abroad.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully read Section 22 of Airbnb's Terms of Service to understand the arbitration process and class action waiver. They should also consider whether they are comfortable giving up their right to sue in court or join class actions. If users have concerns, they may want to consult a legal professional before agreeing to these terms.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly limits users' legal rights and options for resolving disputes. Arbitration clauses and class action waivers can make it harder for users to seek justice, especially in cases involving small claims or systemic issues. The lack of transparency and potential costs associated with arbitration further exacerbate the concern.",
