# Chromecast, Google TV Streamer, Google Nest and your privacy

When you use Google products, you're trusting us with your information. Google is committed to keeping your data private and safe.

The [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) applies to all Google services, including the Google Home app and Google Nest, Google Home, Chromecast, and Google TV Streamer devices. The [Google Nest Privacy Help Center article](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9415830) provides more details about how Google Nest connected home devices and services work, and how we collect and use data when you use these devices and services.

## Information your device may send to Google servers when you choose to share device stats and crash reports

Here's what information is sent to Google servers when you choose to share device stats and crash reports for a particular Google Nest device using the "Help improve your device" setting:

This applies to:

Go to the [Android Help Center](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6078260) for stats and reporting information on: Android TV devices that work with Google Cast, Chromecast with Google TV, and Google TV Streamer.

Go to the [Pixel Tablet Help Center](https://support.google.com/googlepixeltablet/answer/13554750) for stats and reporting information on the Pixel Tablet.

**Note**: This "Help improve your device" setting does not apply to your usage of the Google Home app using your Google Account. To understand what data the Google Home app collects and how it is used, read the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the [Google Nest Privacy Help Center article.](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9415830) You can manage your Google Account settings, including your Web & App Activity setting, at [account.google.com](https://account.google.com).

## Device performance and reliability information

### Usage stats and information

When you choose to share device stats and other information, you help improve how Assistant interacts and communicates for everyone when you use your Nest Hub Max. Once you opt-in,Â a technology called Federated Learning helps Assistant learn how to improve interactions with you, such as automatically adjusting your volume for ambient conditions. Federated Learning allows Assistant to update our machine learning models without sending the text you speak, images from your camera (if you enable camera sensing), or other data from your devices back to Google servers for such learning. Assistant trains the model on your device, and sends a summary of the model changes to Google servers. These summaries are aggregated across many users to provide a better model for everyone. Assistant will only use camera data to train models on-device if you have camera sensing enabled.

## Crash reports and other information

**Device attributes**. We collect basic information about your device hardware model and software version.

**Actively running processes**. We collect information about when your device crashed, which system process crashed, and what other processes were actively running at the time.

## Information Google always collects

Certain device information is necessary to enable performance and reliability of our connected home devices and services and we always collect it, even when you choose not to share device stats and crash reports, such as:

**Device attributes**. We collect basic information about your device type, including model number and build version.

**Activation date and connection status**. This records the date when your device was activated, and whether or not it is connected to the internet.

**Security information**. To quickly resolve any security device errors or outages, we collect information about some security interactions (e.g., camera streaming timestamps).

This data is handled as explained in the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the [Google Nest Privacy Help Center article](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9415830).
