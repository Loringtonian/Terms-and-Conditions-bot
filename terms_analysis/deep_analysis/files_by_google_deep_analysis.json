            "explanation": "These are external companies or organizations that are not part of the primary company (in this case, Files by Google). 'Service providers' typically help the company perform certain tasks (e.g., payment processing, analytics, or customer support), while 'affiliates' are other companies that are owned by or have a close relationship with the primary company.",

            "explanation": "This refers to the lack of clear boundaries or restrictions on what data can be shared, with whom, and for what purposes. Without these details, it’s unclear how much control users have over their data.",
            "user_impact": "The lack of defined limits means your data could potentially be shared more broadly than you might expect, including for purposes unrelated to the app's functionality, such as marketing or advertising.",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that Files by Google can share your personal data with other companies or organizations, including those that are part of Google's corporate group (affiliates) or external service providers. Without clear definitions or limitations, this could include a wide range of data and purposes, potentially exposing your information to risks such as misuse, unauthorized access, or being used for targeted advertising.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review the app’s privacy policy to understand what data is being collected and shared. If the policy is unclear, users should consider reaching out to the company for clarification or limit the data they share with the app (e.g., by adjusting permissions or avoiding uploading sensitive files). Additionally, users should check if there are options to opt out of data sharing.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because sharing data with third parties without clear limitations or transparency poses significant privacy risks. Users may unknowingly expose sensitive information, and the lack of clarity makes it difficult to hold the company accountable or understand how their data is being used."
