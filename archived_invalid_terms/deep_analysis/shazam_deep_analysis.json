These companies are not part of Shazam but work with them to target ads or improve their offerings.",

            "user_impact": "The lack of specificity makes it unclear how your data is being used and whether it aligns with your expectations. It could mean anything from improving app functionality to targeting you with ads, which might not always be in your best interest.",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause allows Shazam to share your personal data with other companies, particularly advertisers, to show you ads or provide services tailored to your preferences. However, it is unclear if your data is anonymized or how securely it is handled, which could expose you to privacy risks like data breaches or misuse of your information.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review Shazam's privacy policy to understand what data is being shared and with whom. Look for options to opt out of data sharing or limit the data you provide to the app. Consider whether you are comfortable with your data being used in this way and take steps to protect your privacy, such as using privacy settings or alternative apps.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because sharing personal data with third parties poses significant privacy risks, especially if the data is not anonymized or secured. Users may not fully understand how their data is being used, and the vague language in the terms makes it difficult to assess the true impact. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as targeted advertising that feels invasive or exposure of sensitive information in the event of a data breach."
