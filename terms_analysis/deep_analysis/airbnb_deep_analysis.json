            "term": "Arbitration clause",
            "explanation": "An arbitration clause means that instead of going to court to resolve disputes with Airbnb, users must use a private arbitration process. This is typically less formal than court and is conducted by a neutral third party.",
            "user_impact": "Users cannot sue Airbnb in a public court or have their case heard by a judge or jury. Arbitration decisions are usually final, with very limited rights to appeal.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What is the arbitration process like, and who selects the arbitrator?",
              "Are there any fees associated with arbitration, and who pays them?",

            "term": "Class action waiver",
            "explanation": "A class action waiver means users cannot join together with others to file a lawsuit or arbitration against Airbnb. Each user must resolve their dispute individually.",
            "user_impact": "Users lose the ability to pool resources and share legal costs with others who have similar claims. This can make it more expensive and less practical to pursue small claims against Airbnb.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What happens if multiple users have the same issue with Airbnb?",
              "Can I still join a group arbitration, or is that also prohibited?",

            "term": "Exemption for Quebec residents",
            "explanation": "The arbitration clause and class action waiver do not apply to residents of Quebec if they bring a legal proceeding in Quebec. This is due to specific consumer protection laws in Quebec.",
            "user_impact": "Quebec residents retain the right to sue Airbnb in court and participate in class actions if the case is filed in Quebec. However, this protection does not extend to Quebec residents traveling or using Airbnb outside of Quebec.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "Does this exemption apply if I am a Quebec resident but use Airbnb in another country?",
              "What happens if I move out of Quebec—do I lose this protection?",
              "Are there any other exceptions to the arbitration clause or class action waiver?"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "practical_meaning": "This clause means that most users in the United States (and potentially other countries outside of Quebec) are required to resolve disputes with Airbnb through private arbitration rather than in court. Additionally, users cannot band together to file class action lawsuits, which can limit their ability to hold Airbnb accountable for widespread issues. Quebec residents are exempt from these restrictions if they file claims in Quebec, but this exemption does not apply to them when traveling abroad.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully read Section 22 of Airbnb's Terms of Service to understand the arbitration process and class action waiver. They should also consider whether they are comfortable giving up their right to sue in court or join class actions. If users have concerns, they may want to consult a legal professional before agreeing to these terms.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly limits users' legal rights and options for resolving disputes. Arbitration clauses and class action waivers can make it harder for users to seek justice, especially in cases involving small claims or systemic issues. The lack of transparency and potential costs associated with arbitration further exacerbate the concern."
