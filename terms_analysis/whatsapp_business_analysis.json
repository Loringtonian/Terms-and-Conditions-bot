They should also evaluate the security and privacy practices of those services to ensure their data is adequately protected. If possible, users should limit the amount of sensitive data shared with third-party services or avoid using them altogether if they are not comfortable with the risks.",
      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it exposes users to significant privacy and security risks. By disclaiming responsibility for third-party services, WhatsApp leaves users vulnerable to potential data misuse, breaches, or unclear terms from those services.
