Terms of Use
============

See previous versions of this and other policies in our [Policy Archives.](https://www.canva.com/policies/policy-archives/)

The text to the right is aimed to give a plain English summary of our Terms of Use. Please ensure you read the main text on the left, as the plain English summary on the right is just a summary and doesn’t capture all of the terms.

Welcome to Canva.com, the website and online service of Canva Pty Ltd (“Canva,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Canva [Privacy Policy](https://www.canva.com/policies/privacy-policy/) , whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, members, contributors and others who access the Service (“Users”).This Agreement hereby incorporates the terms of the following additional documents, including all future amendments or modifications thereto:

1.  [Contributor Agreement⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.canva.com/policies/contributor-agreement/)

Welcome, here are the terms that you agree to when using Canva.

There are a few other documents that may be applicable depending on how you use the Service. Here are links to the other agreements that may be relevant.

Please read this agreement carefully to ensure that you understand each provision.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. Use of Our Service
----------------------

Our Service in a Snapshot. Canva operates an online design platform and media licensing service that empowers our users, members, artists, designers, photographers and others to design and collaborate. We provide ready-made media and content that is licensable for use in accordance with our various licenses.

Eligibility. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Canva, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

In this agreement, a child is considered a person under the age of 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in the child’s country to be able to consent themselves to the processing of their personal data if this age is higher than 13 years old). Children are not permitted to use or access the Service, unless their use of the Service is directly authorized by their parent or guardian or another authorized adult (e.g., a teacher) who agrees to be bound by this Agreement. Any use or access to the Service by a child who is not directly supervised by an adult is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.

The Service may not be available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Canva. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to fully perform all of your obligations hereunder. You further represent and warrant that you are under no legal disability or contractual restriction that prevents you from entering into this Agreement.

License to use the Canva Service. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service and as permitted by the features of the Service. Canva reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Canva Content (as defined below). Canva may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.

Additional terms may apply for any content that you download from, upload to or print from the Service. Any such additional terms will be made available to you prior to initiating any applicable uploads, downloads or prints.

Canva is a great service to use for creating your designs. To use it you must comply with these terms and any laws or regulations. Children are not allowed to use Canva without parental consent and adult supervision.

2\. Canva Accounts
------------------

Your Canva account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Canva account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to Canva with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.

You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. In order to be accepted as a Contributor (as defined below), we may require you to submit a valid photo identification. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You may not allow any other party to access or use the Service with your unique username, password, or other security code. You must notify Canva immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Canva will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your account. By providing Canva your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

Canva usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis and may not be offered for sale, sold, bought, solicited, or inactively held for future use. Inactive accounts may be renamed at any time without notification.

When you create a Canva account, you have to provide us with accurate information. You are responsible for any activity that occurs on your account, so make sure you have a strong password.

Your Canva account is your unique identity. Don’t let anyone else use your Canva account.

You can control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by adjusting your account settings. We might email you important messages and information we think you’ll find useful. We will stop sending you promotional materials if you tell us you’re not interested.

2.1 Teams
---------

Certain portions of the Service, such as Canva Pro (formerly Canva for Work), may allow you to create or contribute to group accounts (“Team”). Access to a Team will be made available only to those Users who are authorized by the creator or controller of the Team (“Team Owner”). The Team Owner will be responsible for adding Users to the Team, for managing permissions for authorized Users, and otherwise for managing the account as set forth in this Agreement.

The Team Owner may contact Canva to assign a new Team Owner. Canva will act on the directions of the Team Owner with respect to any re-assignment of ownership and the deletion and retention of User Content within the Team.

2.2 Canva for Education Terms of Use
------------------------------------

As a way to give back to all the schools that taught and nurtured us, Canva offers Canva for Education for free to teachers and students globally. Eligible teachers with proof of their teaching certification and employment at a school qualify to get free Canva for Education access for their class.

In addition to these Terms of Use, if you are a teacher using Canva for Education, you acknowledge and agree that:

1.  You, or the educational institution you work for, will obtain any necessary parent or guardian consent for a student to use Canva for Education prior to inviting a student to the Canva classroom in accordance with applicable laws, including without limitation the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”);
    
2.  You will only use, and only permit your students to use, Canva for Education (and all content and media incorporated therein) for educational purposes;
    
3.  You will answer questions from Canva in relation to the Canva for Education program and participate in any case study that is reasonably requested. In the event you provide answers or participate in a case study, you grant Canva a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to use and publish the information I provide to Canva, subject to Canva’s [Privacy Policy⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://about.canva.com/privacy-policy/).The Term of a Canva for Education teacher account will start on the date access is granted and end on the earliest of:
    
4.  Three (3) years thereafter;
    
5.  The date when you no longer qualify as a Qualified Educational Institution teacher;
    
6.  The date Canva for Education is discontinued; or
    
7.  Upon receipt of notice of termination from Canva.
    

2.3 Canva for Education Eligibility Guidelines
----------------------------------------------

In order to apply or hold a valid Canva for Education subscription, you must be a Teacher at a Qualified Educational Institution and be able to provide proof thereof.

Students may only be invited to Canva for Education only by a Teacher and shall be eligible to hold a Canva for Education account for so long as they are a student at a Qualified Educational Institution and use Canva under the supervision of a Teacher.

“Qualified Educational Institution” means a public or private primary or secondary school that has been accredited by an authorized governmental agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal or national government and has the primary purpose of teaching its enrolled students.

“Teacher” means an individual person who is an employee or independent contractor working for a Qualified Educational Institution and whose primary role is teaching its enrolled students. Google Certified Educators (GCEs) and Google Certified Trainers (GCTs) are eligible to apply as teachers. Other roles, including but not limited to librarians, teaching aides or assistants, learning support teachers and/or curriculum coordinators may be deemed Teachers by Canva for the purposes of these Terms.

3\. Service Rules

If your User Content breaches our Terms of Use, we may, without prior notice to you, delete such User Content and any other User Content you have uploaded.

We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement. If your account is terminated for any reason, you must obtain written authorization from Canva prior to establishing another account. If you attempt to establish another account without obtaining such authorization, Canva may permanently ban you from the Service. You may not have more than one active account at any time without the written consent of Canva in each instance. If such consent is granted, you may not submit identical Stock Media (as defined below) to more than one account.

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Canva Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Canva shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.

3.2 Anti-discrimination
-----------------------

Canva does not support and will not tolerate its Service being used to discriminate against others, especially when based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin. You are not permitted to use the Service in a manner which would or would likely incite, promote or support such discrimination and you must not use the Service to incite or promote hostility or violence. If we believe in our sole determination that your use of the Service is being used to discriminate, especially if based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin, we may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason.

Don’t be bad. Don’t steal any content, try to hack our servers, send spam or break any other rules, regulations, or laws.

We love working with you, but please don’t stretch the relationship. These are things we don’t want you to do with the Canva brand or trademarks.

Play nice. You’re responsible for your interactions with others. We have the right to terminate our Services or your access to the Service.

4\. User Content

Some areas of the Service allow Users to submit and publish content such as profile information, comments, questions, photographs, illustrations, fonts, designs, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, prints or otherwise makes available on or via the Service without compensation “User Content”). You retain ownership of your User Content, and you understand that if you post User Content under a Brand, the Brand Owner will own—and be entirely responsible for—all such User Content, including any third party Intellectual Property Rights incorporated therein.For the avoidance of doubt, User Content does not include Stock Media (which is covered in our [Contributor Agreement](https://www.canva.com/policies/contributor-agreement/)).

4.2 Uploading and Publishing User Content to Canva.

You agree not to submit or use User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, hostile, violent, or that which provokes violence or hostility, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information which discriminates against others based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin; (vii) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (viii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (ix) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any User Content does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy or publicity. Canva reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Canva believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on or via the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization. Further, you understand that if you contribute User Content under a Brand, the Brand Owner will own—and be entirely responsible for—all such User Content.

For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.

In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:

1.  Your User Content and Canva’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy and publicity rights.
    
2.  Canva may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.
    
3.  There is no suit action or claim or other legal or administrative proceeding now pending or threatened which might directly or indirectly affect any of your User Content or which might in any way impair the rights granted by you hereunder.
    
4.  If your User Content contains or incorporates in any manner any components including but not limited to design elements, fonts, clipart, sprites, vectors or brush tools and the like that are included in design programs, by uploading any such User Content to Canva, you represent and warrant that the end user license agreement, terms of service or the equivalent license agreed to by you allows you to incorporate such elements in the User Content created by you, and to license such User Content to Canva for the purposes set forth herein.
    
5.  Your User Content is neither obscene, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
    
6.  To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.
    
7.  You will not transmit unsolicited emails or engage in spamming to publicize or promote your relationship with Canva.
    
8.  If you use the Service to post, publish, share or print User Content, you agree that you have verified that the User Content does not contain anything that is illegal, encourages illegal activity, infringes (or is otherwise deceptively similar to) any third-party’s Intellectual Property Rights (e.g. uploading full movie or television shows), or otherwise breaches these terms.
    
9.  You will not engage in pay per click advertising using keywords which compete with Canva’s own campaigns in order to promote your relationship with Canva nor will you use or engage a third party on your behalf to use Canva in any domain name.
    

Upon making or learning of any claim that is inconsistent with any of the representations or warranties made by you, Canva shall send you written notice of such claim, using the email address provided by you to Canva, specifying the details of the claim as then known to Canva. Pending the determination of such claim, Canva may withhold from royalties and/or other compensation due to you hereunder, such sums as are reasonably related to the probable value of the claim as determined by Canva.

Canva takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts, publishes or prints over or using the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing and printing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content or Stock Media that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Canva shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content, Stock Media or your use of either in printed form. In the event that your User Content is alleged to be offensive, inappropriate for children, unlawful or otherwise in breach of these terms, you agree that Canva may disclose such User Content to law enforcement or other government authorities.

4.3 User Content on Canva Print
-------------------------------

In some countries, you may be eligible to order prints of your User Content on Canva Print, as part of the Services. Your use of Canva Print is subject to these terms, and may also be subject to the print partner’s terms (if noted when placing your order).

Canva has engaged third party supplies who will be responsible for completing your print order once you submit a print order using the Service. We do not control these third party supplies and your order may, from time to time, be affected by circumstances outside of Canva’s control. If you experience any issues, please visit [Canva Print Customer Service](https://www.canva.com/help/article/canva-print/). Please do not provide our third party suppliers with your personal information at any time.

You may order using Canva Print at your own cost, with such cost to be calculated and included as part of your fee. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee delivery times for orders using Canva Print. If we provide you with a delivery time, it is an estimate only and we are not responsible or liable for any delays with shipping. You agree to hold harmless Canva and its third party suppliers for any loss, cost or expense that you incur in connection with your use of Canva Print.

By printing User Content on Canva Print, you agree to take steps to verify that the User Content does not contain or consist of anything that is prohibited under these terms, the print partner’s terms (if applicable) or is otherwise unlawful. You agree that this is not the responsibility of Canva or its third party suppliers, despite Canva and its third party suppliers having the right to refuse your order (which right you acknowledge).

4.4 User Content in the Community
---------------------------------

4.4.1 Community
---------------

The Community is a forum located at http://community.canva.com (“Community”) for Users that wish to discuss or view online discussions on Canva’s services and products. Community members can share and view information, questions and comments from other Users, as well as follow, message and recognise other Users and review and recognise their posts (“Community Content”). Community Content will become public globally (including places without the same data protection as where you live)

4.4.2 Community Guidelines
--------------------------

To participate in the Community, you must be over 16 and comply with the Community Guidelines, as amended from time to time.

4.4.3 Retention of Community Content
------------------------------------

To participate in the Community, you must be over 16 and comply with the Community Guidelines, as amended from time to time.

Please carefully consider the information you include on the Community and understand that even after you close your account on the Community or Canva, your posts and other information will remain in anonymised form. To request removal of your information from the Community, please contact privacy@canva. If we are unable to remove any of your information, we will let you know why.

4.4.4 Free Community Content
----------------------------

Your Community Content will be offered for free to Users under the licence in clause 5. You will not receive a royalty for Community Content.

4.4.5 Moderation
----------------

The rules applying to User Content under clause 4.1 apply to Community Content. Canva may comment on, move, correct, delete, edit or refuse to publish your Community Content to ensure it is accurate, not misleading and complete, to comply with these Terms of use and our Community Guidelines or maintain the quality of the Community in Canva’s sole discretion.

4.4.6 Third Party Content
-------------------------

If you share a third party’s content on the Community, you must ensure you are permitted to do so under the laws applicable to you (including having a licence or their consent) and provide attribution (unless the third party waives this right or hasn’t consented to their personal information being shared on the Community).

We welcome you to upload content to Canva, but we don’t allow anything that is offensive, obscene, or could constitute or contribute to a criminal or civil offense, including copyright and other Intellectual Property Right violations.

If you want to contribute content to Canva to be licensed to other Users in exchange for royalties, you must agree to the Canva Contributor Agreement.

You promise that you have all necessary permissions and rights to submit the content you provide to us, and that your content won’t infringe anyone’s rights or violate any laws. You promise that your information is truthful. We’re not responsible for your content in any way.

You’re also promising:

– You have sufficient rights to use everything you submit.

– Your content is appropriate for use on our Service.

– You won’t spam people.

– You won’t compete with Canva for advertising clicks to promote your Canva profile.

If we think you’re violating this Agreement, we may freeze your account until we figure it all out.

Canva Print lets you print the awesome designs that you have created on Canva and you can get them delivered to you directly. Basically, if you can’t upload or publish something on Canva, you can’t print it using Canva Print. Canva Print may not be available in your country and since we work with third parties, delivery times are estimates only.

5\. User Content License Grant
------------------------------

By publishing any designs or content containing User Content using the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant to Canva a multi-use, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Canva’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. For the avoidance of doubt, User Content does not include Stock Media. Stock Media is licensed to Canva in accordance with the terms of the [Contributor Agreement](https://about.canva.com/contributor-agreement/).

When you publish Community Content, User Content or designs with User Content, you’re granting us the rights necessary to host them in public view. These rights are only required when you publish User Content on the platform, not for designs that you only download and publish elsewhere.

You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Canva does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Canva, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

We love it when / if you give us feedback and suggestions, but unfortunately we can’t pay you if we implement an idea you sent us.

9\. Paid Services

10\. Canva Property
-------------------

Certain aspects of the service (including but not limited to the Community) may allow you to obtain certain reputational or status indicators (“Canva Property”). You understand and agree that regardless of terminology used, Canva Property represents a limited license right governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and available for distribution at Canva’s sole discretion. Canva Property is not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Canva at any time. You acknowledge that you do not own the account you use to access the Service, nor do you possess any rights of access or rights to data stored by or on behalf of Canva on Canva servers, including without limitation any data representing or embodying any or all of your Canva Property. You agree that Canva has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Canva Property as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Canva will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. All data on Canva’s servers are subject to deletion, alteration or transfer.

Notwithstanding any value attributed to such data by you or any third party, you understand and agree that any data, account history and account content residing on Canva’s servers, may be deleted, altered, moved or transferred at any time for any reason in Canva’s sole discretion, with or without notice and with no liability of any kind. Canva does not provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaims, any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on Canva’s servers.

Although your profile might say “King of Canva”, the status you generate as a Canva User has no monetary value, and we may delete it.

17\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Canva, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, that result from the use of, or inability to use, this service, including without limitation, your submission of User Content or Stock Media. Under no circumstances will Canva be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the service or your account or the information contained therein.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Canva assumes no liability or responsibility for any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the service; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; (vi) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the service; (vii) user content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party; and/or(viii) financial loss from purchasing a Canva subscription from an unauthorised reseller; and/or (ix) loss or deletion of User Content..

No action, regardless of form or nature, arising out of this agreement may be brought by or on behalf of you more than one (1) year after the cause of action first arose.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Canva shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses arising as a result of modifications made to User Content, Stock Media, or other content, any additions or combinations of User Content or Stock Media with other content, or the context in which the User Content, Stock Media, or other content is used by you.

This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Canva has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. Canva makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.

We disclaim all liability in connection with your use of the Service. To the extent we are found liable for anything, the maximum we are obligated to pay is the greater of $100.00 or however much you paid to us.

18\. Governing Law
------------------

You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Canva, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below. If you are a consumer, this agreement does not exclude any rights you may have under the national consumer laws of your jurisdiction.

These terms are governed by the laws of California but don’t exclude your rights under national consumer law. If we need to enforce our Intellectual Property Rights against you, you agree to have the issue resolved only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California.

19\. Arbitration.
-----------------

For any dispute with Canva, you agree to first contact us at [copyright@canva.com](mailto:copyright@canva.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Canva has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Canva claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Canva agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Canva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

If you have any disagreements, contact us first. We’re decent people, but if we can’t work it out, then you agree to submit the dispute to arbitration in Santa Clara County, California (except in certain circumstances relating the protection of Intellectual Property Rights.)

20\. General
------------

20.1 Assignment.
----------------

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Canva without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

20.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.
----------------------------------------------------------

Canva may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Canva in our sole discretion. Canva reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Canva is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Canva may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

20.4 No Waiver.
---------------
