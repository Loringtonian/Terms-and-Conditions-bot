Instead, you must resolve the issue through arbitration, which is a private process that is often less favorable to consumers. The decision made in arbitration is final and cannot be appealed, and you must handle disputes on an individual basis, which can be costly and time-consuming.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review Section 14 of Bumble's terms to understand the arbitration process and how to opt out if they wish to retain their right to go to court. If you decide to opt out, follow the instructions in Section 14 immediately, as there is likely a deadline. Keep a record of your opt-out request for future reference.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because arbitration agreements significantly limit users' legal rights, including the right to a jury trial and the ability to participate in class-action lawsuits. These limitations can make it harder for users to hold companies accountable for unfair practices or resolve disputes effectively. Additionally, the opt-out process is often time-sensitive and not well-publicized, meaning many users may unknowingly waive their rights."
