Dear Ms. Miller and Mr. Ripley,

We welcome this opportunity to submit comments regarding the copyright framework for online intermediaries in Canada. We strongly support the consultation’s goals of protecting and encouraging the use of copyright-protected content online, safeguarding individual rights and freedoms in an open Internet, and facilitating a flourishing digital market. We also welcome the Government’s clarification that it is not currently contemplating significant changes to Canada’s basic model of intermediary liability, calling the current model a cornerstone of the Canadian framework, which is carefully maintained in its international commitments.

In this submission, we would like to share how Facebook is accomplishing the consultation’s objectives under the current regulatory framework. We would also be happy to meet with the Government to follow up on any point of interest.

## Facebook Supports Canadian Culture Online

As we noted in our [testimony](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/INDU/meeting-139/evidence#Int-10396618)[Footnote 1](#fn1) at the Industry, Science and Technology Committee on November 26, 2018, Facebook encourages creativity and the spread of culture online. We believe that, through our platforms, content creators from all walks of life—including musicians, sports leagues, publishers and television and film studios, among others—are given new ways to share their content, reach new audiences and promote their creativity. Facebook also gives rights holders tools to protect and promote their content, while also ensuring the right of freedom of expression for all users.

Many copyright holders have Facebook Pages and Instagram accounts and use our free tools to promote and expand the reach of their content. This has been particularly important for artists and creators during the COVID-19 pandemic, when physical gatherings and performances have been restricted and difficult to undertake.

During this challenging time, Facebook Canada partnered with the National Arts Centre to create [#CanadaPerforms](https://nac-cna.ca/en/canadaperforms)[Footnote 2](#fn2), the COVID-19 relief program that provided support to over 700 artists in the early months of the pandemic, and which has since become [a national platform promoting Canadian culture online](https://nac-cna.ca/en/media/newsrelease/26765)[Footnote 3](#fn3). Over the course of the two months of the emergency relief effort, #CanadaPerforms became a national platform showcasing artists from coast to coast to coast, bringing additional partners onboard to increase its reach and impact sevenfold, including Slaight Music, the RBC Foundation, SiriusXM Canada and the Bennett Family Foundation.

#CanadaPerforms also turned out to be a powerful discovery platform for Canadian artists and Canadian culture. As Heather Gibson, Executive Producer, Popular Music and Variety at the National Arts Centre, [noted](https://www.criticalimprov.com/index.php/csieci/article/view/6471/6103), “What this whole livestreaming platform is about, is about connection. It’s about audiences speaking to artists. . . . It’s the access point and the discovery that’s really exciting to me.” [Footnote 4](#fn4)

As the #CanadaPerforms example demonstrates, consideration of a framework for online intermediaries should take into account the broader economic and cultural value that online platforms bring to promoting Canadian culture and content online.

## Facebook protects intellectual property

Protecting and encouraging the use of copyrighted content online is an essential part of Facebook’s mission. The creators who choose to share their work on our platforms are some of our most important partners and users, and we are pleased to offer free services that they can use to express themselves and connect with new audiences.

We are proud that creators find value in posting their content to Facebook and Instagram—for example, using Facebook Live, Pages or Groups, or Instagram accounts. And we want to ensure that creators have a trusted environment to share that content. This means working hard to stop people from appropriating or misusing their work. To combat copyright infringement, we have put in place comprehensive policies and procedures to help creators of all sizes effectively and efficiently control how their content appears on our platforms, and we have invested significantly in developing powerful IP protection tools.

For example, we have built a world-class content management tool called Rights Manager, a robust global notice-and-takedown program, a comprehensive repeat infringer policy, user education hubs (to help prevent infringement in advance), and other sophisticated tools and initiatives that help rights holders control the use of their content and identify potential IP violations. We also work to detect and address infringing material ourselves. We have developed these tools and practices in close collaboration with rights holders, taking into account their changing needs and shifts in the online ecosystem, all while ensuring that users’ rights to lawful freedom of expression are protected.

We have invested significantly in supporting rights holders via our IP protection work. This work begins with our policies. Facebook’s [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php)[Footnote 5](#fn5) and [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/)[Footnote 6](#fn6), as well as Instagram’s [Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/1215086795543252)[Footnote 7](#fn7) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/477434105621119)[Footnote 8](#fn8), prohibit users from posting content that infringes third parties’ IP rights. We have detailed Intellectual Property Help Centers for both [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property)[Footnote 9](#fn9) and [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/535503073130320)[Footnote 10](#fn10), where users and rights holders can learn more about our policies and procedures.

To ensure quick and accurate handling of IP reports, we provide dedicated channels for rights holders to report content that they believe infringes their rights. These include custom online reporting forms dedicated to copyright and other IP violations, through which rights holders can report different types of content they believe are infringing, including individual posts, photos, videos, or advertisements, as well as entire Instagram accounts and Facebook profiles, Pages, Groups or events. We also allow for rights holders to report multiple pieces of content in a single report, further enhancing and streamlining the reporting process. We are continually exploring ways to streamline the reporting process, and in March 2021, we updated our online copyright reporting forms to improve the rights holder’s reporting experience. In particular, we reduced the number of required fields and the number of clicks to complete the forms. We also updated the format and sequence of fields to be more intuitive, easier-to-use, easier-to-understand, and where possible, pre-filled the form with the rights holder’s information.

Each report submitted by a rights holder is processed by our IP Operations team, a global team of trained professionals who provide around-the-clock coverage in multiple languages, every day of the year. If a report is complete and valid, the team will promptly remove the reported content—typically in less than 24 hours, and often within hours or even minutes. If any information is missing, or if the team needs to clarify anything, more information may be requested, and rights holders can communicate directly with the team via email in those situations. We believe that this manual processing is important in striking the right balance to ensure that rights holders have clear and effective processes for enforcing their rights, and that content is removed only in response to complete and valid reports, to help safeguard users’ lawful free speech rights.

When we receive a report of infringement in a specific post, we do not limit our review to the individual post, but in appropriate circumstances instead look at the entire account, Group or Page to determine whether it is dedicated generally to infringing activity. Where such an account, Group or Page is dedicated to infringing activity, we will disable the actor even if the rights holder has reported just a single piece of content. In addition to outright removals, we may take other actions, including prohibiting the posting of content for a set period of time or, in the case of repeat infringers, disabling their Facebook or Instagram accounts, as appropriate.

Finally, Facebook or Instagram users who believe that a copyright takedown request is not justified can file an appeal, and instructions on submitting an appeal are provided in the email notification to the user at the time of removal. Additional information about Facebook’s notice-and-takedown processes can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/1020633957973118?helpref=about_content).[Footnote 11](#fn11)

## Scaled content management and matching tool

Our collaboration with rights holders is a central component of our approach to stopping IP infringement, as it provides insight into trends and developments that we address through our enforcement measures.

As just one example of this collaboration, we built and have further enhanced Rights Manager, our scaled content management and matching tool, based on feedback and input from all types of rights holders. Rights Manager is a video-, audio- and image-matching tool that we developed for creators to identify content on Facebook and Instagram, including Live videos, that match their copyrighted content. Rights holders of all sizes — from individual creators to television and movie studios, sports leagues, music entities and others — can have access to Rights Manager when simple criteria are met, subject to an application process.

Once approved, participating rights holders can upload reference files of their copyrighted content directly into Rights Manager. Thereafter, when a match to a user’s uploaded video is detected, the rights holder can decide what action to take on that matching video, depending upon the rights holder’s particular needs and circumstances. These actions include the capability to block the content from being viewed by anyone other than the uploading user. In some instances, if a rights holder chooses to block all content matching certain criteria, it can significantly reduce their need to submit future reports (though users maintain the ability to dispute blocks where appropriate).

Rights Manager gives rights holders many other options as well. For example, instead of blocking content, rights holders may choose to monitor it for insights about how their content is performing on the platform — consistent with rights holders’ desire to understand the current and potential audience for their content. Alternatively, rights holders can choose to place a banner on matching user videos that links to a promotional destination of their choice, or they can claim ad earnings from the video (which allows them to gain the revenue that is generated from ads that may run on the matched video). Importantly, use of Rights Manager is free for rights holders.

## Facebook and music

We have also signed agreements with members of the music industry to enable new music-related experiences for users, artists and songwriters on Facebook and Instagram. This includes a [licensing program](https://www.facebook.com/formedia/blog/building-community-together-with-music)[Footnote 12](#fn12) that currently covers the majority of music rights holders in over 90 music markets, including the US, UK, France, Germany and Australia. We have this program because we believe there is value for Facebook, music rights holders and our users when we enable people to freely express themselves and connect with others through music.

We were pleased to bring this licensing program to [Canada](https://www.facebook.com/formedia/blog/bringing-music-to-facebook-and-instagram-in-canada)[Footnote 13](#fn13) in early 2020. Canadians now have new ways to express themselves, discover artists and share music that matters to them. We have seen artists and songwriters reach new audiences, build their brands and connect and engage deeply with fans through our products. Canada has a rich music ecosystem, and these new experiences are made possible through new partnerships with music publishing societies and organizations, as well as labels and distributors in Canada. We are excited to do more to connect people on deeper levels with the music they love and offer artists and songwriters new ways to build their brands.

We believe these programs not only support the music industry in Canada, but the musicians themselves. For example, in the wake of the success of #CanadaPerforms, the COVID-19 relief program discussed above, we were pleased that SOCAN “approved the allocation of a portion of licensing revenue collected from Facebook” for its [*Encore!* Program](https://www.socan.com/socan-gets-music-makers-paid-for-live-facebook-and-instagram-concerts-with-encore-program/)[Footnote 14](#fn14) to provide additional payments for a live music event on Facebook or Instagram to the artists involved.

Our systems and features are not static. We continue to enhance in-stream ads with new features and functionality to support monetizing more types of video content, and we’ve expanded the availability of [fan subscriptions](https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/fan-subs)[Footnote 15](#fn15), [Stars](https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/stars)[Footnote 16](#fn16), and [Paid Online Events](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/paid-online-events/)[Footnote 17](#fn17) so that fans can support their favorite creators.

## Transparency

In conjunction with our IP enforcement efforts, we also prioritize education and transparency, which manifests in several ways. First, when content is removed from Facebook or Instagram based on an IP report, a notification is sent to the reported user at the time of removal providing information about the report, the reporting party and the violation that occurred. Notably, users are also informed of our repeat infringer policy and are told that if they continue to post infringing content, further actions will be taken, including potentially disabling their account.We believe these notifications are essential to make clear to determined bad actors that we have no tolerance for infringement and, on the other hand, to potentially rehabilitate users who had an inadvertent or isolated instance of infringement. We also maintain detailed Intellectual Property Help Centers on both [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property)[Footnote 18](#fn18) and [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/intellectualproperty)[Footnote 19](#fn19) that provide information to users and rights holders about IP as well as our policies and procedures.

Additionally, since late 2017, we have published a semi-annual [Intellectual Property Transparency Report](https://transparency.facebook.com/intellectual-property)[Footnote 20](#fn20) that provides information on our IP policies and procedures as well as data regarding IP removals. This data covers the volume of copyright, trademark, and counterfeit reports received by Facebook and Instagram over a given six-month period, the amount of content removed in response to those reports and the corresponding removal rate. We recently released the Intellectual Property Transparency Report covering the period July to December 2020—and for the first time including information related to our proactive IP enforcement in addition to the actions we take in response to reports. As described in the report, in the second half of 2020, the majority of content we took action on for potential copyright-related violations was removed proactively. Specifically, on Facebook, 77.9% of all copyright-related removals were done proactively, accounting for 9,822,070 pieces of content, and on Instagram, 59% of all copyright-related removals were done proactively, accounting for 2,170,529 pieces of content. Along with the [Transparency Report](https://transparency.fb.com/data/intellectual-property/?from=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.facebook.com%2Fintellectual-property)[Footnote 21](#fn21) itself, additional information can be found in our [Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/how-were-proactively-combating-counterfeits-and-piracy/)[Footnote 22](#fn22) and [IP Protection on Facebook and Instagram](https://transparency.fb.com/sr/fb-ip-protection/)[Footnote 23](#fn23).

We believe that our platforms make a significant contribution to Canadian culture online through its marketing, promotion and discovery effects and are proud of Facebook’s investment in, and commitment to, IP protection and creators. We welcome the Government’s clarification that it is not currently contemplating significant changes to Canada’s basic model of intermediary liability. We appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on this important issue and are happy to discuss these matters further.

Sincerely,

**Original Signed**
