They should also consider what types of data they are comfortable sharing with Google and whether to use alternative services for sensitive communications or storage.",

The lack of clear opt-out options and the potential for misuse or unintended consequences (e.g., data breaches, profiling) make this a significant privacy concern, especially for users in regions with stricter data protection expectations like Canada."
