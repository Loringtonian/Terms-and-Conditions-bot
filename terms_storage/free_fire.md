The zombie mode used to be my favorite. Good to see you brought it back but there lies a lot of issues in it. Whenever I start the zombie mode, the loading screen just freezes at 99%. After that the game needs restarting, after which I join the game, where I have missed the weapon selection phase and have no choice but to battle with shotguns. Please fix this issue, it's extremely frustrating.

WTH is this game, I just played this last night, is it just me or all that I battle with are bots. And it is surprisingly bad, well "some" of the designs in the characters, guns and cars is good but most are bad, so bad. It's also hard to control, unlike other games that you can fix where you want the fire button, reload, and other controls, this game sucks, you can only fix the joystick, the weapons and other minor controls. If and only if they can fix these kind of problems then it will be gud

I've been experiencing severe ping issues while playing ff and it's making the game nearly unplayable. The lag spikes are unpredictable, causing constant delays in movement and actions. Sometimes, my character teleports or freezes, making competitive play frustrating. I've tried troubleshooting—checking my internet, using a wired connection, and even lowering graphics settings—but the problem persists. It seems like the servers might be unstable or poorly optimized for my region.
