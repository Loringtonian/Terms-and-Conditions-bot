These systems look for patterns or specific data to perform tasks like detecting spam, malware, or illegal content, and to personalize your experience by suggesting content or showing targeted ads.",
            "user_impact": "This means Google is constantly scanning your content, even private documents, to gather data about you. This data is then used to improve their services, but also to create personalized ads and recommendations, which can feel invasive if you value privacy.",

            "user_impact": "Your activity and content are being used to create a profile of your preferences and behavior. While this can make services more convenient, it also means Google is building a detailed understanding of your habits, which could be shared with advertisers or other third parties.",

            "explanation": "This means that Google scans your content at every stage—when you upload it, share it, or even just save it in your account. This analysis is ongoing and happens in real-time.",
            "user_impact": "Even if you don’t actively share your content, Google is still analyzing it. This could raise concerns about the privacy of sensitive or confidential information stored in Google Docs.",

This data is used to improve their services, detect harmful content, and personalize your experience, including showing you targeted ads. However, this also means that Google has access to a significant amount of personal and potentially sensitive information, which could be concerning for users who value privacy.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should review their Google account settings, particularly the Ads Settings, to limit or turn off personalization. They should also consider whether they are comfortable storing sensitive or confidential information on Google Docs, given the level of data analysis. If privacy is a major concern, users might want to explore alternative services with stronger privacy protections.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves the continuous and pervasive analysis of user content, including private and sensitive information. This level of data access and processing can feel invasive and raises significant privacy concerns, especially for users who may not fully understand the extent of Google's data collection and usage practices."
