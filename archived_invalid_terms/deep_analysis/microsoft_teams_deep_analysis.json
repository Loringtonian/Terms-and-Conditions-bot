Microsoft reserves the right to update and modify the TOU at any time without notice to you. The most current version of the TOU can be reviewed by clicking on the \"Terms of Use\" hyperlink located at the bottom of our web pages. When we make updates to the TOU, Microsoft will update the date at the top of this page.

            "explanation": "This means Microsoft can change the rules governing your use of their services whenever they want, without informing you beforehand. You are expected to comply with the new terms simply by continuing to use their services.",
            "user_impact": "Users might unknowingly agree to new terms that could significantly alter their rights, responsibilities, or privacy protections. For example, Microsoft could add clauses that allow them to collect more personal data or limit your ability to take legal action against them.",

            "term": "By using the website after a new version of the TOU has been posted, you agree to the terms of such new version.",
            "explanation": "This means that simply using Microsoft’s services after they update the terms is considered as your agreement to the new terms, even if you haven’t explicitly read or accepted them.",
            "user_impact": "You might unknowingly agree to terms that you haven’t reviewed, which could include changes that negatively affect your rights or impose new obligations on you.",

        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause allows Microsoft to change the rules of their services at any time without notifying users directly. Users are expected to regularly check the terms themselves and are automatically bound by any updates simply by continuing to use the service. This puts the burden on users to stay informed and could result in them unknowingly agreeing to unfavorable changes.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should regularly review the Terms of Use on Microsoft’s website to stay informed about any changes. If you notice updates, carefully review them to ensure you’re comfortable with the new terms. If you disagree with the changes, consider whether you want to continue using the service. Additionally, users should ask Microsoft for more transparency, such as email notifications for updates.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it gives Microsoft unilateral power to change the terms without notifying users, which could significantly impact user rights and obligations. The lack of notice or explicit consent means users might unknowingly agree to terms that could harm their privacy, limit their legal recourse, or impose new restrictions on their use of the service."
