            "term": "Arbitration Agreement",
            "explanation": "An arbitration agreement means that if you have a dispute with Netflix, you agree to resolve it through a private process called arbitration instead of going to court. Arbitration is handled by a neutral third party, but it is less formal than a court trial and usually cannot be appealed.",
            "user_impact": "This means you give up your right to take Netflix to court for most disputes, including having a judge or jury decide your case.",

            "term": "Class Action Waiver",
            "explanation": "A class action waiver means that you cannot join with other users to file a lawsuit against Netflix as a group. Instead, you must resolve disputes individually.",
            "user_impact": "This limits your ability to combine resources with other users who may have similar complaints, which can make it harder and more expensive to pursue legal action.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What happens if many users have the same issue with Netflix?",

          {
            "term": "Small Claims Court Exception",
            "explanation": "The terms state that disputes that qualify for small claims court can still be taken to that court instead of arbitration. Small claims court is a simpler, less formal court process for resolving smaller disputes, usually involving limited amounts of money.",
            "user_impact": "This provides a narrow exception where you can still take Netflix to court, but only for disputes that meet the specific criteria for small claims court in your jurisdiction.",
            "questions_to_ask": [
              "What is the monetary limit for disputes in small claims court?",
              "What types of disputes qualify for small claims court?",
              "Can Netflix still require arbitration for disputes that qualify for small claims court?"

        ],
        "practical_meaning": "In practice, this clause means that if you have a dispute with Netflix, you cannot sue them in court or join a class action lawsuit with other users. Instead, you must resolve the issue through arbitration, which is a private process that often favors companies over individuals. The only exception is if your dispute qualifies for small claims court, which has strict limits on the types and amounts of claims it can handle.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully consider whether they are comfortable giving up their right to sue Netflix in court or join a class action lawsuit. If not, they may want to reconsider agreeing to these terms. Users should also familiarize themselves with the arbitration process and the small claims court rules in their jurisdiction.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it significantly limits users' legal rights and options for resolving disputes. Arbitration often favors companies, and the class action waiver prevents users from pooling resources to address widespread issues, which can make it harder for individuals to hold Netflix accountable for potential wrongdoing."
