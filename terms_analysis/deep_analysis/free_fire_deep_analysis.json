            "explanation": "The app claims that no user data is shared with third parties, but it does not clarify whether data is shared with affiliates, subsidiaries, or other entities that may not be classified as 'third parties.' Additionally, it does not specify how data is handled internally or if it is used for purposes like targeted advertising or analytics.",
            "user_impact": "This could mean that while your data is not sold or shared with external companies, it might still be used within the developer's network or shared with related entities. This lack of transparency could lead to misuse or unauthorized sharing of your personal information without your explicit knowledge.",

            "user_impact": "Without knowing the exact types of data collected, users cannot fully understand what information they are sharing or how it might be used. This lack of detail makes it harder to assess the risks of using the app.",

It could still be shared within the developer's network or used for purposes like advertising or analytics. Additionally, the lack of clarity on data collection and regional variations in privacy practices means users cannot fully understand or control how their data is being handled.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review the app's full privacy policy (if available) to understand how their data is being used and shared. They should also consider reaching out to the developer for clarification on the terms flagged above. If the answers are unsatisfactory, users may want to reconsider using the app or limit the personal information they provide.",
        "severity_justification": "This concern is flagged as high severity because it involves potential misuse or unauthorized sharing of sensitive user data. The lack of transparency and specificity in the terms makes it difficult for users to make informed decisions about their privacy, which could lead to significant risks, such as identity theft, financial fraud, or unwanted targeted advertising."
