This could include changes to how your data is used, your rights to use the service, or even your ability to take legal action against the company.",
        "user_action_needed": "Users should regularly check the terms of service for updates and ensure they understand any changes. If the company provides notifications, make sure to read them promptly. Consider reaching out to the company to ask for clarification or to express concerns if the changes seem unfair or unclear.",
        "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it directly impacts users' ability to make informed decisions about their relationship with the company. Unilateral changes to terms without sufficient notice or consent can lead to users unknowingly agreeing to unfavorable or harmful conditions, which undermines trust and transparency."
