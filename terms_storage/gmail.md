## Privacy notice

The Government of Canada is committed to providing websites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy policy for Healthy Canadians' online activities.

All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the [*Privacy Act*](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/). This means that you will be informed of the purpose for which your personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.

### Your Privacy and the Internet

The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, the Government of Canada considers the IP address to be personal

Unless otherwise noted, the Government of Canada does not automatically gather information from you, such as your name, telephone number or e-mail address. The Government of Canada would only obtain this type of information if you supply it to us, for example by email, or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement.

In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the Web server of the third-party service provider.

### Communicating with the Government of Canada

If you choose to send the Government of Canada an email or complete a feedback form online, your personal information is used by the Government of Canada in order to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. The Government of Canada does not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than to those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the Privacy Act.

Emails and other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are not secure unless it is specifically stated on a Web page. Therefore, it is recommended that you **do not** send sensitive personal information, such as your Social Insurance Number or your date of birth, through non-secure electronic means.

Personal information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to the federal *[Department of Health Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/H-3.2/page-1.html)*, the *[Public Health Agency of Canada Act](http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-29.5/)*, and statutes for which the Minister of Health is responsible. Such information may be used for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in Personal Information [*Public Communications (PSU 914).*](http://www.infosource.gc.ca/emp/emp03-eng.asp#psu914)

### Improving Your Experience on Government of Canada Web Sites

#### Digital Markers (including cookies)

A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the website. Examples of digital markers are "cookies" or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:

Healthy Canadians uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its website. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with the Healthy Canadians' Web server. The digital markers used do not allow Healthy Canadians to identify individuals.

You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with the Healthy Canadians website.

#### Web Analytics

Web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about Web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage. Information in digital markers may be used for the purpose of web analytics to remember your online interactions with the Healthy Canadians website.

Healthy Canadians uses Webtrends and Google Analytics to improve its web site. When your computer requests a Healthy Canadians Web page, our institution collects the following types of information for Web analytics:

Healthy Canadians uses Webtrends internally and retains information collected for Web analytics for a maximum period of 18 months. After this period, the information must be disposed of in accordance with the Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics and as authorized by the Librarian and Archivist of Canada. Healthy Canadians also uses Google Analytics and the information collected is disclosed to Google, an external third party service provider. Your IP address is anonymized prior to being stored on the service provider's servers in order to help safeguard your privacy. The information collected is de-personalized by activating the anonymization feature in Google Analytics.

Data collected for Web analytics purposes goes outside of Canada to the United States of America and may be subject to the governing legislation of that country, such as the [USA Patriot Act](http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/patriot/).

Information used for the purpose of Web analytics is collected pursuant to the *[Department of Health Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/H-3.2/page-1.html)*, the *[Public Health Agency of Canada Act](http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-29.5/)*, and statutes for which the Minister of Health is responsible. Such data may be used for communications and information technology statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting. For more information on how your privacy is safeguarded in relation to web analytics, see the *Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics.*

### Protecting the Security of Government of Canada Websites

The Government of Canada employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that has contacted our website, the date and time of the visit, and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.

This information is collected pursuant to [section 161 of the Financial Administration Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-69.html#docCont). The information may be shared with appropriate law enforcement authorities if suspected criminal activities are detected. Such information may be used for network security related statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting and is included in Personal Information Bank [Public Communications (PSU 914](http://www.infosource.gc.ca/emp/emp03-eng.asp#psu914))
