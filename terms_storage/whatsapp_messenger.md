About this app
--------------

_arrow\_forward_

WhatsApp from Meta is a FREE messaging and video calling app. It’s used by over 2B people in more than 180 countries. It’s simple, reliable, and private, so you can easily keep in touch with your friends and family. WhatsApp works across mobile and desktop even on slow connections, with no subscription fees*.

Private messaging across the world

Your personal messages and calls to friends and family are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of your chats, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.

Simple and secure connections, right away

All you need is your phone number, no user names or logins. You can quickly view your contacts who are on WhatsApp and start messaging.

High quality voice and video calls

Make secure video and voice calls with up to 8 people for free*. Your calls work across mobile devices using your phone’s Internet service, even on slow connections.

Group chats to keep you in contact

Stay in touch with your friends and family. End-to-end encrypted group chats let you share messages, photos, videos and documents across mobile and desktop.

Stay connected in real time

Share your location with only those in your individual or group chat, and stop sharing at any time. Or record a voice message to connect quickly.

Share daily moments through Status

Status allows you to share text, photos, video and GIF updates that disappear after 24 hours. You can choose to share status posts with all your contacts or just selected ones.

Use WhatsApp on your Wear OS watch to continue conversations, reply to messages, and take calls - all from your wrist. And, leverage tiles and complications to easily access your chats and send voice messages.

*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.

Overall an extremely quick and simple app with new features like every month. Only bone to pick for me is the poor filesharing options. I have to use other services to transfer uncommon file types, since odd files cannot be directly downloaded from WhatsApp. Other than that, love this app, huge thank you to the Devs.

it works, does what it advertises, but God forbid I forget to update. got locked out of notifications without knowing, and sent my mom into a panic, all because my date setting was too far ahead- it literally worked again by just setting my date back. it wasn't even an API issue, just a software lock. Easily removed, and yet here it is, having just caused a headache.

I was really hoping for a smooth messaging experience, but WhatsApp has been a letdown. The app frequently crashes and the notifications are inconsistent, which makes it frustrating to keep up with conversations. Plus, the user interface can feel cluttered at times. I also have concerns about privacy and data security. Overall, I expected more from such a popular app. Time to look for alternatives
