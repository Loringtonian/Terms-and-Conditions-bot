      "severity_justification": "This was flagged as high severity because it involves extensive data collection and analysis that users cannot opt out of, which raises significant privacy concerns. Additionally, the language in the terms makes it clear that these practices are integral to the service, leaving users with little control or choice over how their data is used. This could have serious implications for user privacy, especially if sensitive data is being collected or shared with third parties.",
