# NRC X (Twitter) policy statement

The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) uses X (Twitter), a free micro-blogging platform, as one tool in its efforts to communicate and interact quickly and in an interesting manner with Canadians.

The NRC's X (Twitter) feeds are managed by the Communications Branch, on behalf of the research centres and programs across the NRC.

## Content

The NRC's X (Twitter) feeds are mainly used as complementary outlets to inform and interact with Canadians on a wide variety of topics. NRC feeds include posts about upcoming events, program updates, new scientific breakthroughs and industry insights, as well as "retweets" of selected information deemed relevant and pertinent to followers. The NRC may occasionally use automation (such as tools that generate messages from RSS feeds), but automated messages are not intended to dominate the posted tweets.

The NRC's use of X (Twitter) is intended to encourage interaction between users of this platform and the NRC. But in no way does this verify or confirm the accuracy of user comments.

If you are looking for information about the NRC, visit the [NRC website](/en).

## Tweet frequency

The number of posts will vary. During some periods, the NRC may tweet more or less often than average. You should expect to receive tweets during regular working hours, Monday to Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST/EDT. Any X (Twitter) activity during holidays, after core hours or on weekends would likely contain emergency or urgent communications of significant value to our followers. Otherwise, NRC feeds will be relatively inactive during these times.

## Following and unfollowing

The NRC will only follow other Government of Canada institutions and organizations that it believes are relevant to the NRC's mandate and business goals.

The NRC reserves the right to remove or block any followers who post content that is deemed inappropriate, inaccurate or offensive, or who do not abide by the following terms of use and do not comply with [X's (Twitter) "Terms of service"](https://twitter.com/en/tos).

Being a follower of the NRC's X (Twitter) feeds does not imply that the NRC endorses the follower or that the NRC follows that particular user.

## Retweets

The NRC may retweet relevant material posted by other Government of Canada X (Twitter) accounts and/or other accounts it considers relevant and of significant value to its followers. The content of retweets may include cross-links, research findings, statistics, relevant events and conferences.

## @Replies and direct messages

The NRC welcomes feedback and ideas from all its followers, and invites new followers to join the conversation where possible. However, the NRC cannot reply individually to all the messages it receives via X (Twitter). Such messages will be handled on a case-by-case basis and responded to when deemed appropriate.

All @replies and direct messages will be read, and any emerging themes or helpful suggestions will be forwarded to the relevant people at the NRC. The NRC cannot engage on issues concerning party politics or answer questions that violate any of the provisions stated in its [Commenting Policy](#policy).

Reporters are asked to send questions to the NRC Media Relations team by email at [media@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca](mailto:media@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca) and to refrain from submitting questions on the NRC's X (Twitter) feeds.

General contact information is available at "[Contact Us](/en/corporate/contact-us)."

## Links to other websites

Links to websites not under the control of the NRC are provided solely for the convenience of users. The NRC is not responsible for the accuracy, currency or reliability of the content, and offers no guarantees about these links. Nor does the NRC endorse such websites and their content.

## Availability

X (Twitter) updates are subject to downtime that may be out of the NRC's control, because X (Twitter) servers are managed by a third party. As such, the NRC accepts no responsibility for the X (Twitter) network becoming unresponsive or unavailable.

## Accessibility

X (Twitter), as a third party service provider, is not bound by Government of Canada policies for web accessibility.

## Privacy

The NRC's X (Twitter) feeds are not an official Government of Canada website. They represent the NRC's presence on X (Twitter), a third-party service provider. Users are encouraged to read the [X (Twitter) Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy). Any information shared with the NRC on X (Twitter) is subject to the provisions of the *[Access to Information Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/)* and the *[Privacy Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/)*, which means that it may be accessed and disclosed in response to a request under either of these acts.

Users are advised not to share personal information. Personal information includes home addresses and telephone numbers, photographs containing images of identifiable individuals, and any other information consisting of personal information as defined in [Section 3 of the *Privacy Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/page-1.html#h-397182).

Any personal information that you provide to the NRC's X (Twitter) feeds is collected under the authority of the [*Financial Administration Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/), in accordance with the [Communications Policy of the Government of Canada](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30683). This information is being collected to capture conversations between you and the NRC via its X (Twitter) feeds. "Conversations" include questions and answers, comments, "likes", retweets and other interactions where you provide feedback on content that the NRC has posted, or when the NRC provides you with information based on content that you post. For a description of the types of personal information collected, see Personal Information Bank entitled Public Communications (TC PSU 915). Under the provisions of the *[Privacy Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy.html)*, individuals have the right to access, correct and protection their personal information. Instructions for obtaining your personal information are provided in the Government of Canada's "[Info Source](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/info-source.html)", which is available in major public and academic libraries or online.

## Official languages

The NRC respects the *[Official Languages Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html)* and is committed to ensuring that information products of equal quality are available in both French and English. NRC posts will be published simultaneously in both official languages. Comments, responses and questions that require a response will be answered in the official language of origin.

However, users should be aware that some links may direct users to sites of organizations or other entities that are not subject to the *[Official Languages Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html),* and that these sources are only available in the original language in which they were written.

X.com (Twitter) is available in multiple languages including English and French. To change your user preference, go to your account settings and adjust accordingly.

## Copyright

## X (Twitter) Commenting Policy

The NRC welcomes and encourages comments on its X (Twitter) feeds.

You are fully responsible for everything that you submit in your comments, and all posted comments are in the public domain. They will be reviewed by an NRC moderator to ensure that they comply with the provisions stated in the Commenting Policy.

The NRC does not discriminate against any expressed views or opinions, but does reserve the right to edit or remove any posts that are:

Anyone acting contrary to these rules may be temporarily or permanently excluded from the dialogue spaces on the NRC's X (Twitter) feeds.

Any questions or comments about this policy can be submitted to NRC-Communications Branch by email at [info@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca](mailto:info@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca).

### A few other important notes:

The NRC does not promise to reply to every comment posted. It will, however, attempt to engage in conversations when possible. The views of participants commenting on the NRC's X (Twitter) page do not necessarily represent the views of the NRC.

You participate at your own risk, taking personal responsibility for your comments, your username and any information you provide. To protect your own privacy and the privacy of others, please do not include phone numbers or email addresses in the body of your comment.

Additional information can be found on the Canada's "[Terms and conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/transparency/terms.html)" section on its website. The NRC recognizes that the Web is a 24/7 medium and therefore your comments are welcome at any time. However, given the need to manage federal resources, moderating and posting of comments will generally occur only during regular business hours, Monday through Friday. Comments submitted after hours or on weekends will be read and posted as early as possible the next business day.
