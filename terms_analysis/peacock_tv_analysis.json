      "practical_meaning": "In practice, this lack of transparency means that Peacock TV could be collecting a wide range of personal information about you without your full understanding. They could also be sharing or selling this data to advertisers, partners, or other third parties without explicitly informing you. This creates a significant privacy risk because you have no control or insight into how your data is being handled.",
      "user_action_needed": "Users should carefully review Peacock TV's privacy policy (if available separately) to understand their data practices. If the privacy policy is also unclear or unavailable, users should consider limiting the personal information they provide, using privacy tools (e.g., VPNs or ad blockers), and contacting Peacock TV to request clarification on their data practices.",
      "severity_justification": "This issue is flagged as high severity because it directly impacts user privacy and trust. Without clear information on data collection and sharing, users are left vulnerable to potential misuse of their personal information, such as unauthorized data sharing, targeted advertising, or even data breaches. Transparency is critical for informed consent, and its absence is a significant concern.",
